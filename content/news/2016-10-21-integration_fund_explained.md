## It is still time to get involved

We are very proud of all the contributors we have funded until now. Together, we are building the ecommerce of tomorrow, in the spirit of WeCommerce.

But you know the old saying, the more the merrier :) We still have funds to allocate to many local modules.

Do you want to develop a local module in one of the spots below where you see a target? Stop everything and [apply now](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/integration-fund) :)

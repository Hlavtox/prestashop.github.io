An Open Source community is more than just PR made by faceless strangers. In order to better understand the people who contribute time and skills to the PrestaShop project, we're launching a series of interviews with contributors of all ranges. This week, meet Alper Demir!


**Hi Alper! Could you tell us a bit about yourself?**

<img style="border: 1px solid #CCC; float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" width="180" height="180" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/155283423312fb422acc72b8ef875c38?s=180&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcrowdin.com%2Fimages%2Fuser-picture.png">Hi! I am a 36-year-old Industrial Engineer from Turkey, and my hobbies are DIY projects, Software Developing, Coding, and Project Improvements. I discovered PrestaShop while looking for a E-commerce solution that would best fit my working company's needs.

**How and when did you find out about the need for contributive translating?**

When I install and started to use PrestaShop I see that current Turkish translations are mostly done by Machine translation services and I started to re-translate my installation, but every time I lost my translations after update or server faults. So finally, I decided to join to translation team in May 2016. Since then I do not know how many words I translated, but I think too much :) I spend approximately half of my spare time translating.

**Why do you translate?**

I do it to help my company, Turkish users of PrestaShop, and PrestaShop itself.
I am an engineer, profit is not just related to myself. If my country's e-commerce capabilities develop, then all the users will profit from this.

**Why is it important for you to be active in open source translation?**

If someone puts effort in developing something and sharing it freely, then some others should help to improve this. This is win-win relation.

**What's the number one thing you've learnt by contributing to the PrestaShop translation community?**

Check it again & again. While you are translating a big project you have to get control over it. You have to check other sources, documents even your translations again. I learned that with some pain after I constrained to correct my mistakes.
Translating is not easy, sometimes boring, requires attention but contributing is feeling good. ;)

**Thanks you Martin, we hope to see you soon in our Crowdin Monthly reports! :)**

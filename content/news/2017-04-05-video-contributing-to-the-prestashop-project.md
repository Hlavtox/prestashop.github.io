PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 was released last Monday ([have you noticed?](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-available/)), and the improvements and fixes keep coming in, thanks to community members like you!

Not everyone knows that you can contribute in many ways to the PrestaShop project, or even what Open Source means.

So a couple of weeks ago, we made this video, hoping that you could learn more about PrestaShop and its many parts.

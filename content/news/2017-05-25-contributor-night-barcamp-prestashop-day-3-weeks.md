A quick reminder about the PrestaShop Day, and the two community events tagging along!

![PrestaShop Day Paris](/assets/images/2017/04/prestashop-day-paris-2017.jpg)

Do you want to contribute, share experiences and meet the community? All of this is possible this June in Paris: come enjoy the [PrestaShop Day Paris](http://www.prestashopday.com/fr/), and the events that we are setting up for the community!

The event is coming back to Paris, France on Thursday June 15th, and again this year, contributors are invited to join in on the fun with two events: a **Contributor Night** in the PrestaShop office on the day before, and a **Community Barcamp** within the event's walls. Let's meet and exchange!

#### The contributor night

The day before PrestaShop Day (so on Wednesday 14th of June), the PrestaShop team will welcome contributors within our Paris office, so that we can improve PrestaShop 1.7 together, for 3 hours (19:00-22:00).

Join us for the evening, and you will learn how to contribute to the code, the documentation or the translation, all this thanks to the power of Open Source!<br/>
Part the PrestaShop team will be there to get you onboard as mentors, with encouragements  and best practices.

**All participants will be thanked with an invitation to the next day's PrestaShop Day event.**


#### The barcamp within PrestaShop Day

[PrestaShop Day](http://www.prestashopday.com/) will feature an area dedicated to barcamp-style conversations: a non-conference space, open, with exchanges where everyone can participate to the topic. The main idea: "No spectators, only participants".

The whole things takes place in a non-commercial environment: this is not a place to promote a product or service, but a place to share knowledge and experience, so that everyone leaves a better person, with no overhead projector and no PowerPoint presentation.

Come and meet the PrestaShop community!

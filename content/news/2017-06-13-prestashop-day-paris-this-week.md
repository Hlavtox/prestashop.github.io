PrestaShop Day is shaping up to be a great event again ([grab your ticket](http://www.prestashopday.com/fr/eventbrite/)!), and we are happy to welcome contributors at both the Contributor Night on the day before, and at the barcamp within the PS Day.

[PS Day Paris](http://www.prestashopday.com/fr/) will bring together hundreds of members of the PrestaShop ecosystem, including merchants, agencies, freelancers, students, etc. 

Many are coming to Paris especially for this event (as well as the [WordCamp Europe](https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/) from our friends in the WordPress community on Friday and Saturday). This is a great occasion to mingle and exchange -- as well as celebrate PrestaShop's 10th birthday!

As you know, two community events are being prepared:

* the **Contributor Night**, on the day before, right in PrestaShop's Paris office.
* the **barcamp**, during the PS Day, in its own location within the walls of the global event.

Join us for community fun! You can [add yourself to the Contributor Night](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/PrestaShop-Paris-Ecommerce-Meetup/events/240083244/) on Meetup.com, and [suggest barcamp topics right now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfap99ZfFmiEK94P79lsBUcfpyGfc8lrY9LO-yt4_lWp6vH8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) -- you can also suggest topics on the day of the event, if there are time slots available.

The current barcamp topics are about SEO, Community, Theme creation, Symfony, and contributing. [What would like to talk about](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfap99ZfFmiEK94P79lsBUcfpyGfc8lrY9LO-yt4_lWp6vH8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)?

See you soon!

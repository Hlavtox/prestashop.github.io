A few weeks ago, a new initiative was started: PrestaShop Project Office Hours.

The concept is simple: once a week, project members make themselves available to the community to discuss topics directly related to the PrestaShop open source project.

So far, three meetings have been held which were a chance to discuss a number of topics:
- project structure and processes
- helping finish and merge some PRs from the community
- multi-store features
- the future of core architecture

And hopefully more discussions will come during the upcoming meetings.

## Join the next meeting!

Would you like to discuss a Pull Request you are working on? Or the future of the project? Do you just want to listen to the discussion? If so, joining the meeting will be a great idea.

## When and where?

Feel free to join on [this Google Meet link](https://meet.google.com/fer-hcgk-wti).
Office Hours are held *every Tuesday* (except days that are bank holidays in most European countries) from 11:00 AM to 12 PM CET.

If you want to suggest topics for discussion, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/2r7jPp5WxhFSUQme8) (it is not required, though!).

See you at the next meeting :wave:

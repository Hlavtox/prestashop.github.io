A lot of work has been done on the new back office for PrestaShop 1.7, most notably the reworked Product page and Modules page; as well as the brand new theme. Now, we need you to tell us what you think -- face to face! <br/>
_As a reminder, the [PrestaShop 1.7 Project FAQ](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/) is available._

A big part of the PrestaShop 1.7 project was making sure that this new version had a design that would help merchants do their daily tasks faster and with less confusion. As for any User Experience (UX) project, there comes a time when the choices which have been made have to be reviewed by real users, in order to validate them.


## User testing

User-testing are the proper way to do that. We contact a user (most often a merchant, but also developers, logisticians, etc.), get them to come to our Paris office, and sit them down in front of a machine in order to see how they react to the new interface. 

The user is not alone: two members of the Prestacrew will assist her/him, and the whole session is recorded for later use.

This face-to-face discovery gives invaluable feedback on what we’ve done so far, and shows us what is left to do in order to be as close to perfection as possible. From these weekly real-life feedback, we iterate between UX designers, product managers and developers, and the next batch of testers can already see our improvements.


## Come on in!

And you can be a part of it! We are looking for people (ideally from the Paris region) who would be able to come to our Paris office ([right next to the St Lazare station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PrestaShop/@48.8762495,2.3249603,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66f7819172fd7:0x8d51ecfa59c5cdba) -- hence the Paris region thing, see) for an hour and a half, testing the few features we have cooked for the whole community.

Ideally, you should:

* Be at ease with managing an online store on a daily basis, 
* Be used to navigating the PrestaShop 1.6 back office (or earlier version), or the back office of any other e-commerce software, 
* Have not yet tested PrestaShop 1.7 -- in order for your reaction to be genuine.

Also, you must speak either French or English, and be able to read English :)


## What early testers have to say

Are you scared to be lost with the new interface? See what Clément, from renowned store [Le Slip Français](http://www.leslipfrancais.fr/fr/), had to say after his session:

This year, for the first time, a Call for Papers was organised for a PrestaShop event. The objective was to give a voice to the community and learn from its active members. Let's make a quick tour of the results.


## Because it's 2020

Launched during Spring with a Google Form, the Call for Papers was originally targeted for PrestaShop Day Paris 2020, scheduled to take place last June. Unfortunately, due to the health crisis, this event was canceled, like all other in-person events. However, many people had submitted talk proposals, so, there was many questions left. The most obvious one was to know if a French event, "IRL" or virtual, would be organised during the second semester.

Once it was decided to hold a virtual event in October, it was possible to think about using the talk proposals. And, with the PrestaShop company's Events team, the work started to find a way to include talks from the CFP in the schedule.

The result was great: 4 speakers from the community participated and their talks have been recorded.


## The talks

For this first edition, all talks were in French only, as they were targeted for PSDay Paris. Below is the list of the talks, and the recordings, available on Youtube.

In parallel, the tech team at PrestaShop organised "Stream your tech", targeted to the developer community. It is a live streaming to share what they do and answer to questions. It has been recorded in two parts, listed below. And, as there has been great feedback about it, this kind of format will certainly be organised again (stay tuned).

## Conclusion

The Call For Papers was quite new to organise, and difficult to keep in 2020, but overall, it was great to make it happen. And I really hope it will be possible to organise a new one next year. Please, share in the comments what you liked the most this year, what could be improved, and what you would like to see in 2021.

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software that happens online every October, sponsored by the American cloud hosting company [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com). People are encouraged to engage and create at least 4 pull requests for open-source projects on GitHub.

If you want to contribute to open-source projects but donâ€™t know where to start, Hacktoberfest might be the perfect opportunity for you.

## How does that work?

Your goal is to contribute with at least 4 quality pull requests to the open-source project you like. Digitalocean will send every contributor achieving this goal a pack of goodies, including a t-shirt and set of unique stickers.

Everyone is welcome, especially beginners. Just find the open-source projects you want to be involved in and do your bit! It is a simple process:

:wave: Register for Hacktoberfest first. It is [right here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register).

:computer: Create pull requests to get involved in your favorite projects - they must have a public GitHub repository.

:white_check_mark: Make sure your pull requests match Hacktoberfest's [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards).

:bulb: Remember to let us know that you're participating in the event. You can put information in your Pull Request's description.

:busts_in_silhouette: Wait for the project maintainers to review your contributions.

:repeat: Do it again to achieve the goal of 4 pull requests!

In order to make sure old release packages remain available for anyone who needs them, we published a new [GitHub repository "ZIP Archives"](https://github.com/PrestaShop/zip-archives), which aims to store all published PrestaShop ZIP archives.

## Keeping trace of the past

All the past versions of PrestaShop that the team could get their hands on were added to the repository since version 1.0.0.0.

Past versions of the software can be useful for developers who have to intervene on a PrestaShop application running an old version, for example, to perform maintenance or upgrade.

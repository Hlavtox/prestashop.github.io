In order to make sure they remain available for anyone who need them, the maintainer team published a new [GitHub repository "ZIP Archives"](https://github.com/PrestaShop/zip-archives) which aims to store all published PrestaShop ZIP archives.

## Keeping trace of the past

All the past versions of PrestaShop the team could get their hands on were added to the repository since version 1.0.0.0 .

Past versions of the software can be useful for developers which have to intervene on an PrestaShop application running an old version, for example to perform maintainance or upgrade.

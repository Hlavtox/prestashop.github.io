An Open Source community is more than just PR made by faceless strangers. In order to better understand the people who contribute time and skills to the PrestaShop project, we're launching a series of interviews with contributors of all ranges. This week, meet [Roberto Calisto](https://crowdin.com/profile/roberto.calisto)!

**Hi Roberto! First, could you tell us a bit about yourself?**

Hello, my name is Roberto Calisto. I'm a 44 young man, married and father of two daughters. I am a Portuguese who take a lot of pride in the history of his little country and language. A language that is, for those who do not know, "only" the sixth most talked in the world.

I have made some academic study in philosophy and theology that opened my horizons to the complexity of the world and the humankind. I love travelling, photography also. I am passionate about history and really enjoy discovering new places and cultures.


**When and why did you get involved in contributing to the PrestaShop project? What motivates you?**

Since about five years. I have been managing a PrestaShop store ([Sapataria Rosita](https://www.sapatariarosita.pt/index.php)) and, since the beginning, I can see expressions are still missing translation in my language. And because I value the Portuguese, it did not make sense for me to have this language not yet completely translated. So when I was asked to help in this effort to finish the translation, I was very happy. I finished translating the last strings into Portuguese this month, it was a very good feeling: the honor to put "the cherry on the top of the cake". Of course, I am aware that the result of the Portuguese being all translated was the joint effort of many other people.

What really motivates me is trying to do better every day, to make this daily effort in order to surpass myself. It sounds kind of stupid but I think this simple "translation job" has everything to do with the rest of our lives. Although it is difficult, I think it is possible to build a better future for humanity, and I like to think that, in history, I will be part of this imaginary list of unknown people who contributed a bit for that.


**Do you have any advice for first-time PrestaShop contributors?**

My advice is: do not give up. Remember you are not alone on this path. Unity is strength and your little contributions will make a great difference in the future. You are not translating; you are in fact contributing to a better future.


**What’s the number one thing you’ve learnt by contributing to Open Source projects?**

I have learned that when we "pull" for each other, we help one another and are happier. Because we got achievements that, alone, would be practically impossible for us.


**Thank you Roberto, we hope to see you more from you as PrestaShop evolves! :)**

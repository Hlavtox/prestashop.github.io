![Core Monthly banner](/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg)

Dear community,

Welcome to the first Core Monthly of 2023! 2022 was a fantastic year for the PrestaShop project, with [a new major release]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-0-0-available" >}}), [announcement of the upcoming new theme]({{< relref "/news/posts/2022/new-theme-announce" >}}) for PrestaShop, and significant changes to the project's structure, which made it more open than it has ever been.

In 2022, the project welcomed new members in the [committers team](https://www.prestashop-project.org/maintainers-guide/project-organization/#committers), to help with its growth. It was also the second year where you could see other project members and me in the [Public Demo]({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2022/upcoming-demo-9-2022" >}}). And for the first time, discuss with us during [office hours]({{< relref "/news/posts/2022/office-hours" >}}).

All project members wish you all the best in 2023! Now, let's get into the summary of December.

Here's what happened:

### Release of PrestaShop 1.7.8.8

PrestaShop 1.7.8.8 was released on December 8th. This maintenance release fixed some bugs and regressions but, more importantly, provided the community with a security fix. It's worth noting that it's the last regular version of PrestaShop 1.7. You can [read the release notes for this version]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-1-7-8-8-maintenance-release" >}}) to learn more.

### PrestaShop 8.0.1

The first patch version for PrestaShop 8 is on the horizon. With over [30 bug fixes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+milestone%3A8.0.1+label%3A%22Bug+fix%22) and [plenty of minor improvements](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+milestone%3A8.0.1+label%3AImprovement) this version aims to increase the stability of the latest major release.

I understand that some of you are waiting for the first patch to start thinking about the upgrade. The good news is that the autoupgrade module is now available, and the patch version [is currently being tested](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/30128#issuecomment-1365937573) by the Quality Assurance team.

### Autoupgrade module

Speaking of upgrades, [autoupgrade v4.15 is now live](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.15.0). As I'm writing this article, PrestaShop 8 is not available in the module interface yet, but the module itself has everything needed for the upgrade to succeed. If you don’t see PrestaShop 8 as a new major release, you can upgrade to the latest version using the `Local archive` or `Local directory` option.

The release zip file, along with the xml file required by the module, [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/8.0.0). If you don’t know how to upgrade using these files, [watch this short video](https://youtu.be/SBz7lApJ_pA?t=1063) that I showed during the Public Demo.

### Pull requests overview

In December, there were over 200 merged pull requests across the project. Let's dig into some of the most interesting contributions that target PrestaShop 8.1 and module updates.

**Enabling profiler in back office**

Thanks to [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox), in PrestaShop 8.1, it will be possible to enable the Front office profiler directly from the Back office, without needing to modify any file. There's still some work to do regarding this feature, as the community requested to add an extra security layer to let only shop maintainers see the results of profiling. You can see the [details in the pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30603).

**Update from Vue 2 to Vue 3**

Core components written in Vue 2 are now fully migrated to Vue 3, mainly to ensure that the project uses a supported version of the framework. It was also a chance to do a little cleanup.
You can see the migration details in [this massive pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/28463). Kudos to [@NeOMakinG](https://github.com/NeOMakinG) for such amazing work!

**Making PrestaShop core better**

Every release includes minor changes that improve the software's core in some way or another. This time I present you a pull request where [@FabienPapet](https://github.com/FabienPapet) refactored `Tools::str2url` so that it uses the `StringModifier` utility class. Thanks to his work, the function is now fully unit-tested, and the project has become more stable and reliable. You can see all the [implementation details in the pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30357).

I would also like to thank developers from [@StoreCommanderDev](https://github.com/StoreCommanderDev) for [fixing a very tricky issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30540) with the `Product::getAttributesResume` method, which could return incorrect data in some scenarios.

**Faceted search module**

There's a new version of the Faceted Search module available. This release brings a set of new features and improvements, such as [setting a default template for filters](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/pull/728), [performance improvements](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/pull/727), and [changes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/pull/726) to simplify the module's codebase.

Thanks to [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox), [@leemyongpakvn](https://github.com/leemyongpakvn), and [@zuk3975](https://github.com/zuk3975) for the work on this new version.

**Changes in the productcomments module**

[@micka-fdz](https://github.com/micka-fdz) reported that the `productcomments` module was causing trouble with generated microdata on product listings. Not only Mickaël submitted a bug report, but he managed to [fix the issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments/pull/150) as well! 

The second interesting change from this module is coming from me. I [fixed some issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments/pull/149) with the customer's last name anonymization. There was a critical error if the anonymization was enabled and the customer used the last name starting with a special character, like `Ł` for instance. This would cause comments not to be displayed. Both changes are coming to `productcomments` v5.0.3, which should be released in the upcoming weeks.

**Big changes in the developer documentation**

The last thing I wanted to mention is the changes in the developer documentation. Thanks to the [outstanding work](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/1579) done by [@thomasnares](https://github.com/thomasnares), documentation now has a [brand new hooks page](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/concepts/hooks/list-of-hooks/). The list of hooks now shows the location where the hooks are displayed or executed, as well as whether it has an example implementation in the documentation. By the time I write this article, there is one [example for the `actionValidateOrder`](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/concepts/hooks/list-of-hooks/actionvalidateorder/). If you want to contribute some examples feel free to submit a Pull Request. To learn more on how to contribute to DevDocs, [read this article](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/documentation/how/).

In May, we released PrestaShop 8.1 RC1, shared some exciting news about PrestaShop 9, and continued improving the core and the modules. Let's take a closer look at recent developments in the project in May.

### Live Update

The last Live Update took place on May 17th. You can read all the details [in the summary]({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2023/live-update-5-2023" >}}). We didn't share the date of the next Live Update back then, but we agreed now that we will host the next session on June 21st. More details about it soon.

I would also like to mention again that Live Updates for us are a great chance to interact with the community. If you have any questions about the project, you can ask them before the Live Update, and we'll answer them live. You can ask questions [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7).

### PrestaShop 8.1 release candidate 1

A few weeks ago, we released PrestaShop 8.1 RC1. It's one of the latest steps before releasing the stable version of PrestaShop 8.1. We're very close to the final release, so if you haven't tested the RC1 yet, now is the time to do it. We wait till June 26th for your feedback. In the meantime, we'll be working on fixing the bugs you report and the [autoupgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) to allow you to upgrade from previous versions of PrestaShop to 8.1.

You can find the RC1 [release notes here]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-1-rc1-release" >}}).

### PrestaShop 9 news!

Work on PrestaShop 9 has already started. As of now we can see a lof of cleaning in the core, removing deprecated functions, upgrading dependencies, but also some new existing features coming. Let's do a little recap.

**PHP 8.1 as a minimum compatible version in PrestaShop 9.0**

You read that right. After discussing internally and with the community, the leadership council decided to bump the minimum compatible version of PHP to version 8.1. It's great news for developers who want to use the latest features of PHP in their modules. It's also great news for the PrestaShop core, as we can use the some of the latest features of PHP in the core. We'll also be able to use the latest versions of our dependencies, making the core more secure and faster. You can read [full announcement about the decision]({{< relref "/news/posts/2023/prestashop-9-min-php-version-will-be-81" >}}).

**Symfony 5.4**

Yes! Symfony has been upgraded from version 4.4 to [version 5.4](https://symfony.com/releases/5.4). It's one of the [long-term supported versions](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html#maintenance). As with every new version of Symfony, there are some [new features](https://symfony.com/blog/category/living-on-the-edge/6.0-5.4?page=1) available for developers, as well as breaking changes. Right now, we [list all the notable changes in PrestaShop 9](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/1658), so that we can later add them into the developer documentation.

If you are interesting in how the upgrade process looked like, you can see [this pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31216).

**New default theme (?)**

A few months ago [we informed about Hummingbird]({{< relref "/news/posts/2022/new-theme-announce" >}}). Since then, a lot has changed in the theme. Currently, work on the theme continues [based on the list of issues](https://github.com/orgs/PrestaShop/projects/11) that were split into those that are a must-have for the first test version, nice-to-haves, and so on. We will need your help testing and making the default theme for PrestaShop as best as possible. If you are a developer and want to discuss with us the future of front-end in PrestaShop, make sure to visit us on the [project's Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/), `#hummingbird-theme` channel. It hasn't been decided yet whether `Hummingbird` will replace Classic or will be an alternative theme. We'll keep you updated.

### Changes in the developer documentation

It looks like those developer documentation updates are now regular part of Core Monthly series! In May we managed to improve the documentation in a few areas, for example, a new page has been created that lists some of the [global variables available in front office templates](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/themes/reference/templates/variables/). There were also some tiny design improvements, but what's worth mentioning is that two big updates are coming in June, one regarding [working with PrestaShop & Docker](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/1661), and one [explaining web service API in PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/1673) in much more details with more examples. Stay tuned!

### Native modules

In this part of the Core Monthly I would like to send special thank-you message to (@leemyongpakvn)[https://github.com/leemyongpakvn] who is doing an amazing job helping us with maintenance of modules, by upgrading Github Actions and taking care of the modules. Thank you!

### Project's general news

A few general news around the project. In May, we welcomed [@boherm] as a new committer to the project. There were also a few updates on the [project's website](https://www.prestashop-project.org/). We now have a dedicated page about [security policy in the project](https://www.prestashop-project.org/security/). Quality Council also added their own page documenting their processes and work. You can find it [here](https://www.prestashop-project.org/quality-council/). More changes to the project's website regarding [a new project organization introduced in April]({{< relref "/news/posts/2023/a-new-organization-for-the-open-source-project" >}}) is coming soon.

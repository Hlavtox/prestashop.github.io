As we enter May, let's recap the key accomplishments within the PrestaShop project during April. We focused on vital security upgrades, namely PrestaShop 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, as well as putting the final touches on PrestaShop 8.1. A new project organization was also introduced, and the developer documentation received several updates. Read on to learn more about the latest developments in the PrestaShop project.

### New project organization

On April 19th, 2023, [@eternoendless](https://github.com/eternoendless) unveiled a "A clearer, more transparent, more collaborative organization" for the project, that has been under development for the past few months. This revamped organization aims to streamline decision-making within the project. To learn more about the new structure, how it will function, and the next steps, we highly recommend reading the [dedicated article]({{< relref "/news/posts/2023/a-new-organization-for-the-open-source-project" >}}) on the Build blog. The organization was also presented during [April's Live Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbAQ__A6ns), you can watch the replay [here](https://youtu.be/SVbAQ__A6ns?t=179).

### PrestaShop 1.7.8.9 and 8.0.4

In April, the PrestaShop project released important security fixes for versions 1.7.8 and 8.0, addressing multiple vulnerabilities. These include a critical SQL filter bypass ([GHSA-p379-cxqh-q822](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-p379-cxqh-q822)) that could lead to arbitrary write requests using "SQL Manager," a high-severity arbitrary file read issue ([GHSA-8r4m-5p6p-52rp](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-8r4m-5p6p-52rp)), a high-severity XSS injection vulnerability through the Validate::isCleanHTML method ([GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp)), and a moderate-severity CSRF token fixation ([GHSA-3g43-x7qr-96ph](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-3g43-x7qr-96ph)). The fixes have been implemented to bolster the platform's security and protect users from potential threats. If you use PrestaShop 1.7.8 or 8.0 I highly recommend you to upgrade your store to the latest version.

The [upgrades are small](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare/8.0.3...8.0.4) and does not require any database changes. You can implement those changes by simply replacing the files on your server. During the 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 upgrade process using [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module, some issues were encountered, which were likely caused by the [psgdpr](https://github.com/PrestaShop/psgdpr) module. However, it's not the only reason for failed upgrades, and further investigation is needed.

### PrestaShop 8.1

As PrestaShop 8.1 nears its second beta release, the project is focusing on several key elements necessary for a successful launch. Two of these crucial aspects include completing the translation catalog export and making the autoupgrade module compatible with PrestaShop 8.1. These efforts will enable the community to translate the new version and ensure a seamless upgrade process. You can follow the release process in the [dedicated issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/30719).

### Developer documentation improvements

April brought yet another round of enhancements to the [DevDocs](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/)! This month, we introduced a revamped homepage for the documentation, emphasizing the main content sections. Additionally, we added a section featuring the most viewed pages in the docs.

Alongside these updates, we welcomed several improvements from the community and three significant additions to the documentation:
- [PrestaShopCollection component documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/database/prestashopcollection/)
- [A full guide on how to extend the new product page in PrestaShop 8.1 back office](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/sample-modules/extend-product-page/)
- [Refreshed upgrade guide showing how to upgrade from PrestaShop 1.7 to 8.0 using CLI](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/basics/keeping-up-to-date/upgrade-module/)

You can see the full list of changes [here](#changes-in-developer-documentation-sources).

### Upgrades in native modules

Not that much happened around the modules in April, but something worth mentioning is a refactored version of [psgdpr](https://github.com/PrestaShop/psgdpr) module. The new 2.0.0 version caused some troubles, so it was reverted to the previous version. The module is now back to v1, and we are working on the new version to fix issues reported by the community. You can follow the progress in [this issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/32459).

Other than that, there are some wording improvements and other minor fixes in the modules.

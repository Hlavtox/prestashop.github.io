### Patch releases for PrestaShop 8

Two new versions for PrestaShop 8 are now available. 8.0.2 and 8.0.3 versions were both released a few weeks ago. You can read more about those releases in their release notes, [for 8.0.2]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-0-2-maintenance-release" >}}), and for [for 8.0.3]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-0-3-maintenance-release" >}}).

### Changes in core for PrestaShop 8.1 and PrestaShop 9

Work around PrestaShop 8.1 is almost finished. Work in March was mostly about remaining tasks around the new product page, which will be enabled for new installations of PrestaShop starting with version 8.1. If you want to know more about PrestaShop 8.1, [watch March's Live Update](({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2023/live-update-3-2023" >}})) where I presented some of the best features of this version.

Of course, a lot is going on around PrestaShop 9.0. Thanks to [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984), we see a lot of [deprecated code being removed from the core](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Amerged+label%3A%22BC+break%22+author%3AProgi1984+milestone%3A9.0.0+) for the next major version. If you develop solutions for PrestaShop, it's worth following these changes.

Apart from refactoring, there are new existing features coming to v9. [Improved guest management in back office](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/27769) is now available thanks to work from [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox). Daniel (Hlavtox) also took some time to work on various improvements around wording in back office. [His PR](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31322) unifying page names, grid names and form names is now merged to the `develop` branch.

We also had a chance to merge some performance improvements. Worth checking are two PRs, one [optimizing db structure](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31729) for `connections` table from [@lmeyer1](https://github.com/lmeyer1), and one from [@tom-combet](https://github.com/tom-combet) drastically [improving performance for `StockManager` queries](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/28854). There's also one PR improving shopping cart performance in the front office, [@lmeyer1](https://github.com/lmeyer1) [optimized](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31300) `CartPresenter` so it no longer calls `present()` function multiple times on the same page.

### Improvements in the developer documentation

Developer documentation is undoubtedly a significant part of your project. In March, we took the time to improve it where required, focusing on the search feature. We didn't act blind, as we use Algolia DocSearch: we could analyze the most frequently searched items, and based on that, we made adjustments and produced new content. We discovered some undocumented things. Some were searched using different phrases than those indexed by Algolia (e.g., FormHelper instead of HelperForm, etc.).

Thanks to the improvements we made, from now on:
- there's a much more precise search feature in the developer documentation
- thanks to the new tags mechanism, we can improve search results by mapping some of the phrases that are used by developers to corresponding results that are indexed using a different wording
- hooks with normal and dynamic names (for example, action<ObjectModelName>UpdateAfter, etc.) are now visible in the search results
- `Link`, and `Locale` components are now documented, as well as `hookModuleRoutes` and some other elements.

Below are links to the developer documentation sections that were improved or added:
- [Developer documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/)
- [Documentation for the "Link" component](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/link/)
- [Documentation for the "Locale" component](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/locale/)
- [Improved docs for HelperForm and HelperList](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/helpers/#the-main-helpers)
- [Improved docs for “Db” component](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/database/db/)
- [Docs for hookModuleRoutes](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/concepts/hooks/list-of-hooks/moduleroutes/) [with an example module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/example-modules/tree/master/demomoduleroutes)

### Google Analytics 4 

A new version of Google Analytics integration is now available. Full support for GA4 is now integrated directly into the module. If you want to keep collecting Universal Analytics data, a module created by [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox) does just that. You can read more in the [module's repository](https://github.com/Hlavtox/ps_oldgoogleanalytics). If you want to download the newest version of the Google Analytics module, you can do that from the [releases page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics/releases/).

### Project's telemetry

In addition to the numerous updates last month, starting with PrestaShop 8.0.3, during the software installation, a "Privacy note" section has been added, detailing the potential telemetry included in PrestaShop modules. As we strive for transparency, the telemetry implementation in the upcoming Distribution API release will provide valuable insights into software usage patterns, enabling more informed decision-making in the future. To learn more, please refer to the new ["Data transparency" page](https://www.prestashop-project.org/data-transparency/) on the project's website.

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last two weeks, from Monday 7th of September to Sunday 20th.


## Milestones

The current stable version of PrestaShop is [version 1.6.1.1 of PrestaShop](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1611-maintenance-release/), and this week we released the Release Candidate for the second [patch version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/) of branch 1.6.1.x: [we need you to test that v1.6.1.2 RC1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-2-rc1/) is ready for production and does indeed fix the closed issues!

Meanwhile, the team is hard at work on version 1.7.0.0, and we published some information on this blog already:

 * [Initial launch of 1.7.0.0 project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/version-1-7-0-0-is-underway/).
 * [Starter Theme collaborative project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-kickoff/).
 * [Recent technological changes in 1.7.0.0 codebase](http://build.prestashop.com/news/cldr-composer-jshint/): CLDR, Composer, JSHint, etc.

More information is coming soon, among which explanation of where we aim to take the [new architecture that was introduced in v1.6.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-architecture-1-6-1-0/), and details about some forthcoming design changes.

Do you want to contribute your code skills to the PrestaShop project? [Make sure your Git setup is correctly configured](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/set-up-your-git-for-contributing/), and that you follow our [new branching model](http://build.prestashop.com/news/introducing-new-branching-model-prestashop/)! Then, [read these documentation pages](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+to+PrestaShop).

The Core Weekly will now have separate sections for major branches. You can see the work being done on the following branches: 1.6.1.x, develop, and feat/starter-theme.

Of note among the merged PRs since the last Core Weekly Report:

 * We reached PR [4000](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/4000)!

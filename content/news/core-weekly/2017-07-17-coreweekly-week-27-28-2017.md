## General messages

The feedback phase for 1.7.2.0 RC1 closed this Sunday at midnight! The Core team has taken into account most of the issues tied to this version -- and if not, 1.7.2.1 is not far away, thanks to our easy upgrade path :) We're now entering the last stretch: internal QA tests and final small fixes.

Hence, expect 1.7.2.0 in the comings weeks!

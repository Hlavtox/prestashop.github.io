This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 6th to Sunday 12th of February 2017.


## General messages

A healthy reminder, folks: check out our [Release Schedule for 2017](http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-our-2017-release-schedule/). The [recently-released 1.7.0.5](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-0-5-maintenance-release/) is just one step in this calendar, and we intend to keep releasing monthly versions.

One notable event since last week is that the team really went all out on handling dusty pull requests. Numerous PRs were reviewed, tested and either merged or closed. This is great news for the community, for two reasons:<br/>

* First, because many contributors who submitted a PR and felt it was forgotten now received feedback from the Core team, either a positive one or one that should help them improve their future contributions.
* Second, because by processing more than a hundred PRs, the team has cleared the view on the remaining PRs. We now have a better understanding of what our next moves can be, and we hope to process more PRs soon, in order to be more responsive to community feedback.

As of this writing, [we have 110 open PRs](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) (for all branches) -- discounting those which are already milestoned, [we are below 90 PRs left to be processed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aopen%20no%3Amilestone)! This is thrilling!

Found an issue in PrestaShop 1.7? [Create a Forge ticket](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) -- or create a PR! Thank you for your contribution to the PrestaShop project!


## Code changes in 'develop' branch (for the next minor version, v1.7.1.0)

Now let's review the merged pull-requests on the ['develop' branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) since the last Core Weekly Report!

Note that 1.7 patch versions are being built in the '1.7.0.x' branch. All of the PRs from that branch are eventually ported in the 'develop' branch.

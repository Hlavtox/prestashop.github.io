## General messages

Last week saw the [release of PrestaShop 1.7.1.1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-1-maintenance-release/), which fixes a good number of painful points discovered after the release of v1.7.1.0. [Go download it](https://www.prestashop.com/en/download)!

While we expect v1.7.1.2 to be released next month, work continues on v1.7.2.0 (mostly the stock management feature) and v1.6 (1.6.1.13 should be released soon).

Thank you for contributing with reports and pull requests!

## General messages

It's September! This means new ideas, new projects, new versions, new everything!

For starters, [PrestaShop 1.7.2.2 was released last week](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-2-2-maintenance-release/), and as you can see from the merged commits below, version 1.6.1.17 is coming soon. What's not to like?

The team is also working on version 1.7.3.0, which we will talk about more in the coming weeks.

There are other cool things to talk about, and this month should plenty of Build content to read. Looking forward to pushing the "Publish" button!

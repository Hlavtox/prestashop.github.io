## General messages

Dear developers,

Last two weeks there was [some reports](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/20079) of people unable to login into their Back-Office after upgrading to 1.7.6.7.

Obviously the project maintainers explored this topic deeply but were unable to find any issues into the code. We believe some of the issues might come from [third party upgrade tools](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/20177) that would not follow PrestaShop migration path. If you have valuable feedback, feel free to [tell us on GitHub]((https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/20079))!

In the meantime, work continues on `1.7.7.x` branch to prepare the first Release Candidate and on `develop` branch to bring some long-awaited features for 1.7.8, such as [php7.4-compatibility](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/18787) or [native lazy-loading](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/19560).

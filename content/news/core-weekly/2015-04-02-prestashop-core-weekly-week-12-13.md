Hello everyone, and welcome back to the weekly... Core Weekly!
Well, this is a special bi-weekly edition, since a lot have happened outside of Core for PrestaShop lately :)
We'll get back to our weekly scheduling for the next Core Weekly.

As always, we try to highlight changes in PrestaShop core codebase last two week, from Monday 16th to Sunday 29th.

The Core Weekly report is ever evolving, so if you have ideas on how to improve it, let me know!

## Milestones

There's been a huge milestone for PrestaShop this week: we moved! It took a few days, but now that we're settling down (with Puff Daddy, our own in-house kitten!), I can finish the Core Weekly quietly :)
Hey, I took a few picture and built an album with them, check it out! [http://imgur.com/a/Glx7d](http://imgur.com/a/Glx7d)

Also, we started a poll on the forum about moving to PSR-2's Coding Style Guide. Let us know you opinion! [https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/)

## Code changes

Instead of pointing out notable Pull Requests, we are changing the way this section has been presented so far, and list all the PRs from last week, each in its own category, in order to show that all contributions (and contributors!) are important.

As always, click on the PR's number to open its page on GitHub.

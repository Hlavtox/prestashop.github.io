Welcome to the inaugural post relating what has been going on in the development side of PrestaShop!

I aim to make this a weekly occurrence (as the title implies), in which I'll highlight some of the more important happenings in and around the Core.
In short, this is for those who do not visit [https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commits/1.6](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commits/1.6) and [http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/PSCSX](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/PSCSX)) on a daily basis :)


## Milestones

Last week was marked by two milestones:

* We passed 30,000 commits on the 1.6 branch! (currently closing on 30,220)
* We released version 1.6.0.12 (and hotfix 1.6.0.13), with more than 200 changes and fixes, among which:
	* Big work on refund and partial refund
	* New front office classes added to facilitate integration
	* Ability to override specific controllers with ModuleAdminControler
	* Display product images on invoices
	* Installer in French (Quebec) and Portuguese (Portugal)

## Community day

Thursday was also an intense day of discussions and exchanges, when a handful of community participants came to the PrestaShop office in Levallois-Perret (France) in order to talk about everything, from themes to modules, updates and module validation, the tax and rounding issues,  code quality and stability.

Participants where [prestarocket](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/343354-prestarocket/), [2FR3](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/296243-2fr3/), [doekia](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/41515-doekia/), [PrestaEdit](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/103589-j-danse/), [Atch](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/16609-atch/), [EoliaHack](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/241780-eolia/), [SamyRabih](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/186884-samy_r/) and [Mediacom87](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/672955-mediacom87/).

## General messages

Dear developers,

This week we [introduced a new tool](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/16704) in our CI pipeline that we believe will make PrestaShop Javascript a lot easier to read and maintain: we now use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) on the modern BO theme files. This popular tool will help us ensure the monitored code is written in a consistent way, following our [code conventions](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/coding-standards/#javascript-code-conventions). It also looks for possible bugs and issues in the code and reports them at build time.

## A quick update about PrestaShop's GitHub issues and pull requests:

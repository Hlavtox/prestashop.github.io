## General messages

Last week was rather eventful, with the release of both [1.6.1.14](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-14-maintenance-release/) and [1.7.1.2](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-2-maintenance-release/). We're happy to keep delivering patch versions for the current releases of 1.6 and 1.7, while working on the next minor version, 1.7.2.0.

This week looks to be just as eventful, as the whole company will welcome visitors to the PrestaShop Day 2017 in Paris! [Join us](http://www.prestashopday.com/fr/) and let's celebrate PrestaShop's 10 birthday! I myself will be lead the barcamp session -- [you can still suggest topics](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-night-barcamp-prestashop-day-paris-2017/)!

See you there!

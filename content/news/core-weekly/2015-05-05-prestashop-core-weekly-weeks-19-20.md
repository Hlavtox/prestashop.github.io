Another set of short weeks here in Paris, which means another edition of the Core Weekly report that spans two weeks of change to the PrestaShop codebase.

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last two weeks, from Monday 4th of May to Sunday 17th of May, 2015.


## Milestones

The PSR-2 survey is still running, [and you can still vote](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/). It seems pretty settled, though. More updates about this soon!

Of note among the merged PRs in the last two weeks:

 * In [3007](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/3007), PrestaShop R&D Director Jérôme Nadaud (jeromenadaud) introduced a new style to the back-office and login form of PrestaShop, in accordance to the rebranding currently under way at the PrestaShop company. More about that very soon! The design work was done by PrestaShop's Lead Product Designer Julie Chabin (syswarren).
 * In [2967](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/2967), core dev Julien Martin (Shudrum) kept on modifying the email template, removing order_changed.

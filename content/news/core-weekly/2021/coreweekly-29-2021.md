## General messages

Dear developers,

In case you missed it, _we moved the next Public OSS Demo session date_ to [**Wednesday, August 4, 2021 at 4pm CEST**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE6lVtdsIhE). We noticed that 2pm CEST was a little early in the morning for people watching us live from the Americas, so we decided that future sessions will start two hours later â€” at 4pm. We hope this will encourage more of our community to watch the demo live and discuss with us :smile:

Also we are really proud to announce that [PrestaShop Core is compatible with PHP 8.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/25296) in the `develop` branch thanks to [@atomiix](https://github.com/atomiix). The full project is not entirely compliant with PHP 8 yet (some modules need dependencies updates) but this is a major milestone for PrestaShop, just in time to greet [the first beta of PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/archive/2021.php#2021-07-22-1) that was released on July 22!

## General messages

Dear developers,

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is over. But the PrestaShop project continues, stronger than ever.

In case you did not see it, [Autoupgrade module 4.3.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.13.0) was released last week!

Also last week, the projectâ€™s tenth monthly public demo session was held and streamed live on [Wednesday 3rd of November 2021](https://build.prestashop.com/news/public-oss-demo-10-2021/). If you did not watch it and you want to know more about the future of the PrestaShop _open source project_ (and not the software), check what @ttoine presented during the 10th PrestaShop Public Demo!

While [PrestaShop 1.7.8.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/26141) is being tested before release, [PHP 8.1.0 fifth release candidate](https://www.php.net/archive/2021.php#2021-10-28-2) and [Symfony 6.0.0 first beta](https://symfony.com/blog/symfony-6-0-0-beta1-released) have been published!

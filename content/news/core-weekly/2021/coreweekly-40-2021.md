## General messages

Dear developers,

In case you did not see it, [PrestaShop 1.7.8.0](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-available/) was released last week!

Of course, we always recommended using the latest available version of the [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) when upgrading. However, if you are upgrading your shop to 1.7.8 from a version prior to **1.7.6**, make sure the module is updated to version 4.12.0 or later.

As usual, it is recommended to be careful before starting to update your website to the latest version:

- Backup your database and your files
- Test the update on a testing or pre production server
- If everything is fine, then update on the production environment

If you notice issues with PrestaShop 1.7.8.0, you can [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues) and go even further by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare) to help fix it!

Now that 1.7.8.0 is out, we look forward to the future! Do you want to know more about it? Check what [@eternoendless](https://github.com/eternoendless) presented during the 9th [PrestaShop Public Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x37-QOockEo&t=155s)!

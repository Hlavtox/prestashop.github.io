## General messages

Dear Developers,

That was great to meet those of you who came in Paris for the PrestaShop Day. There was a developer space, and a technical track. Many technical questions and some issues were discussed, that is what opportunities to meet in real life are made for ;-)


After Paris, [PrestaShop Day Madrid](https://www.prestashop.com/es/eventos/prestashop-day-madrid) is planned in 2 weeks for June 18th and will gather more than 1,200 people at La Nave Madrid - experts, open source lovers, translators, merchants, partners, etc. You can use the promotionnal code "PSDMADRIDFORUM" to [get your free ticket](https://www.weezevent.com/psd-madrid?o=build)

That said, there is only one week left to finish the Beta of 1.7.6. Once all the bugs will be triaged and fixed, the work on the first release candidate will start. It means it is still time to test the beta, report issues and open pull requests.

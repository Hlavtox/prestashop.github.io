## General messages

May is here! With the successful (and [announced](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/2017-release-schedule/)) releases of one minor version ([1.7.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-available/)) and two patch versions ([1.7.1.1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-1-maintenance-release/) and [1.6.1.13](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-13-maintenance-release/)), the team is now working on the next iterations!

So, this month should bring two new patch versions: 1.7.1.2 and 1.6.1.14. But what of the next minor versions? Well, keen readers of this blog already know:

* 1.7.2.0, which we intend to release in June 2017, will see the addition of a [brand-new Stock Management feature](http://build.prestashop.com/news/stock-management-in-prestashop-1-7/).
* 1.7.3.0, which we intend to release in September 2017, should see a great improvement on internationalization, [particularly for Right-to-Left languages](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/).

As always, your feedback is more than welcome: see the two links above, and thank you for contributing!

See you on Trello, the Forge, or directly on GitHub :)

## General messages

[PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 Beta 1 has been released](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-beta-1/)! We are still working on it (as you can see below), so help us make sure it's a solid version by [reporting issues](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) and [providing pull-requests for bugfixes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/1.7.1.x). Thank you!

If you can't find any issue (yay!) or if you don't know how to fix issues, you can still contribute by [helping with the translation for 1.7.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/171-Translations-update/) :)

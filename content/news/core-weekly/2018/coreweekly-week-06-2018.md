## General messages

Hi folks! Since [version 1.6.1.18](https://www.prestashop.com/en/previous-versions) is released, we’ve spent last week focusing on a few things to have it work perfectly. Like the 1-Click Upgrade module which we’re now improving in order to have it using less memory and providing better error messages.

Also, we’ve build the release candidate of version 1.7.3 last Friday, all is now set for the final act, performed by our great QA team! As soon as they approve it, be sure that Build will spread the word. ;-)

## General messages

Hey guys, nice weekend? Have you noticed weâ€™ve posted the [detailed schedule]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-our-2018-release-schedule) last Friday? We are really happy to share our vision for future releases as we are now planning the bare bones of PrestaShop. And for that we would love to hear your opinion. For instance, item location has disappeared from major version 1.7 but you are often asking about it. Vote for this feature on the [User Voice](http://feedback.prestashop.com) to let us know about it.

Regarding GDPR and the changes it will bring, we are currently working on a module that will be available for 1.5 to 1.7 stores. And of course it will be available before May 25th! A post will soon be posted to tell you everything about it.

## General messages

Last week, we finally achieved the migration from our good old Forge to GitHub! It means that if you want to:

* [Create a bug report or a feature request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose) about PrestaShop 1.6.x, 1.7.x or a module,
* Look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/1),
* Find something to fix for the next release in the [backlog](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/2)

You must now go to the [PrestaShop GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop). You will see that GitHub is very easy to use, that it has a very good user documentation, and that you donâ€™t need to be a developer to use it.

Quick reminder: [PS Day Milano](https://prestashopday.com/it/) is due in one month so it's time to schedule your trip to the best place to meet all of our Italian ecosystem. And thanks to PrestaShop's partner MailChimp, [150 free tickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/biglietti-prestashop-day-milano-44793298963?aff=BuildMailChimp150ticks&discount=MailChimptioffreilbiglietto) are available this week! What are you waiting to get yours? ;-)

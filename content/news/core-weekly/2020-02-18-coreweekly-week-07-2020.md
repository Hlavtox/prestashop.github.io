## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week our Product Team had a wonderful surprise: they received a notification telling them someone opened a [Pull Request on the Specifications repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/pull/86)! This is the first community contribution since this repository dedicated to centralize all core and module functional specifications has been created. They were delighted to see the community willing to collaborate with us on this huge work.

We offer our very big thanks to [@arouiadib](https://github.com/arouiadib) for his contribution. Obviously we would be very happy to welcome more contributions, so if you feel like doing some Product Owner/Manager work, [feel free to join in](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/)!

## General messages

[We released *Beta 3* of PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-3/) last week! Have a go at it, will ya? :)

Want to help things go faster? There are several ways: 

 * [Test the Beta version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-3/) (or better, test [the current development version, straight from GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop)).
 * [Report issues on the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) (or [confirm issues that are already listed](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-738?jql=project%20%3D%20BOOM%20AND%20created%3E%3D-1w%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) - use the search engine!).
 * Fix issues by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) (or confirm that a submitted pull request does indeed fix the presented issue).
 * Help improve the [1.7 tech documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) (both for themes and modules), with issues and pull requests.

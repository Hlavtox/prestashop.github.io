Hi everyone, and welcome to the second edition of the PrestaShop Core Weekly post, focusing on the activity from March 2nd to March 8th of 2015.
As last week's Core Weekly, I'll highlight some of the more important happenings in and around the Core of PrestaShop.

## Milestones

Last week saw the release of [version 1.6.0.14](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/423651-new-release-prestashop-16014/), right after a big week which saw two releases on two consecutive days, [1.6.0.12 and 1.6.0.13](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/428304-prestashop-core-weekly-week-10/). As you can see, the PrestaShop team is willing to go the extra mile to make sure that the user have the best e-commerce software in the industry, and are not willing to compromise, even if it means pushing a new version because of newfound blocker bug.
[See the (short) changelog for 1.6.0.14](https://www.prestashop.com/en/developers-versions/changelog/1.6.0.14).

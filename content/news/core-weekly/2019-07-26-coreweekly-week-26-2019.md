## General messages

Core weekly edition is a bit late, mainly due to beginning of the summer and the first vacations of the team.

So, how is the 1.7.6.0 release? Tell us in the comments, now that you have a few experience with it. Some major issues have been identified, and a 1.7.6.1 release is already on track.

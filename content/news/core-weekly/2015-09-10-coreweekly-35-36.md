This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last three weeks, from Monday 24th of August to Sunday 6th of September.


## Milestones

The latest version of PrestaShop is [version 1.6.1.1 of PrestaShop](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1611-maintenance-release/)! It's the first [patch version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/) of branch 1.6.1.x, meaning that it only contains fixes and improvements, without any new feature. It is therefore a very safe upgrade from version 1.6.1.0.

The team is working on another patch version of 1.6.1.0 (meaning: on version 1.6.1.2): more information here soon!

We are also working on the [next major version of PrestaShop: version 1.7.0.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/version-1-7-0-0-is-underway/)! It is major because we actually plan on break some parts of the retrocompability, and make an even better e-commerce platform. We will of course do our best to keep developers informed so that you know when and how to update your module/theme code! Not everything will be broken, of course, but do expect your creations to not work as-is on 1.7.0.0.

One of the first project we want to tackle with you is the Start Theme, a blank theme that theme designer can use to build their own complete theme! Learn more about it [in this Build article](http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-kickoff/), participate in the [conversation on Gitter](https://gitter.im/PrestaShop/StarterTheme), or contribute ideas and give us your insights on the [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/FPwYidfj/prestashop-startertheme)! And the code is being built [right on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme).

Want to contribute your code skills to the PrestaShop project? [Make sure your Git setup is correctly configured](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/set-up-your-git-for-contributing/), and that you follow our [new branching model](http://build.prestashop.com/news/introducing-new-branching-model-prestashop/)!

Finally, the ever-so-great Alexandra wrote her [monthly Translation report](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-august-2015-edition/), with stats, ranking and charts!

Of note among the merged PRs since the last Core Weekly Report:

 * Over several PRs, contributor gskema fixed the coding standards and indentation of many class files. Great work!
 * In PR 3838, with 69 commits and over 179 files changed, Core developers kelu95 and xGouley implemented CLDR. More on this soon!

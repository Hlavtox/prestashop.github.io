## General messages

Hello :-)
Last week, many of you asked about the release of PrestaShop 1.7.4. Well, I can ensure you that a release candidate is currently being built and tested. 

Also, thanks to the feedback about Auto Upgrade Beta 2, a new beta is available: [v4.0.0 Beta 3](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases). It fixes a few issues and adds more checkings before starting the migration.

If you were concerned by those issues, or even if you just want to help, please continue to test it a and report feedback. You can either comment this blog post or open an issue directly on [Auto Upgrade Module repository on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/issues).

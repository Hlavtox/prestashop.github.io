This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during last week, from Monday 26th of October to Sunday 1st of November.


## Milestones

After pondering for a long time about old tickets and PRs, we chose to contact the author of all currently open submissions on the Forge and on GitHub in order to get their feedback and help us complete the required actions, and make it so that these tickets are not forgotten. We published an [article about reviewing pull request this week on Build](http://build.prestashop.com/news/review-your-pull-requests/).<br/>

If you are the author of an old Forge ticket or of a waiting PR on GitHub, you must have received an e-mail about it this week.

This big call for feedback made it possible to restart the conversation with the Community on numerous topics, to get updated information which will help our team make a decision about what was submitted, and to close a good deal of submissions which were outdated (most notably 1.4 and 1.5 tickets, both versions which are not supported anymore apart from security updates). 

The goal for us is to dive back into the submissions that are left in order to make sure that the Community has its say in the evolution of PrestaShop.

So if you receive such a call-for-update e-mail, please answer it! You don't have to work on it right away, you don't have to spend the whole weekend updating your commits against the latest version of the code: just do what you can on your own time, and we'll see you on the finish line!

Thank you!

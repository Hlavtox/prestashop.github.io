## General messages

As announced in last week's Core Weekly Report, we release 1.6.1.16! It contains the usual number of merged pull requests, and as you know, we plan on continuing supporting PrestaShop 1.6.1.16 with monthly patch releases until October 2018.

Version 1.7.2.0 was rather well received, and we are planning a first patch release for this version in the coming days -- either this week or the next, depending on the tests currently being done. Stay tuned!

Summer is also the time when things slow down a little, which allows for planning ahead. Two articles released last week are going this way:

* "[PrestaShop Design Principles](http://build.prestashop.com/tools/prestashop-design-principles/)" is a short list of what we believe in in terms of design thinking.
* "[An update on the 1.7 RTL project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project-update/)" gives you what it says on the tin. If you want to get involved, join the Trello board!

That's a nice start for August, don't you think?

Core Weekly, expectedly back again for Week 16 of 2015!

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase last week, from Monday 13th to Sunday 19th of April, 2015.

The Core Weekly report is ever evolving, so if you have ideas on how to improve it, let me know!

## Milestones

The PSR-2 survey is still running, [give us your opinion](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/)!

Julien, one of PrestaShop's Core developers, wrote an article about [the best `.gitignore` file for PrestaShop projects](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/prestashop-perfect-gitignore/). If you use Git to version your files, you should definitely read it!

Slow week on the development front, as the Core team spent the first three days of the week in a training session, and thus had little time to both code and accept pull requests.
But I'm telling you, next week will bring a whole lot of merges!

That being said, of note among the merged PRs last week:

 * In PR 2886, gskema added a new parameter in Tools::fileAttachment(), for when you don't want to grab the files content and hold it in memory (especially large files).
 * In PR 2888, ZiZuu-store made a fix to pass the Context in Link->getLanguageLink(), which makes it possible to use the Context into templates and more.

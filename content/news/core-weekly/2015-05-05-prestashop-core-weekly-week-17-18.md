Missed a week, but the Core Weekly report is still alive and kicking!

I spent last week half in a training session, and half on days off. Sorry if you missed that weekly meeting of ours! ...but that only means that this week, you get DOUBLE DOSE of that :)

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last two weeks, from Monday 20th or April to Sunday 3rd of May, 2015.


## Milestones

The PSR-2 survey is still running, [give us your opinion](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/)!

Of note among the merged PRs in the last two weeks:

 * In PR 2865, contributor gskema added a new method, `Language::getIDs()`, which returns an array of language IDs. Very useful when you only need the language ID and not the whole language array. A lot of functions could be refactored by using this new method. Some lines could even lose their `foreach` loops.
 * In PR 2891, core dev jeromenadaud updated Font Awesome to version 4.3.0 (from version 4.0.3).
 * In PR 2655, contributor PrestaEdit added a new Cart hook, named `actionAfterDeleteProductInCart`. Comment if you think "`actionCartProductRemoveAfter`" would be a better name!
 * In PR 2554, contributor PrestaEdit added a new Mail hook, named `actionGetExtraMailTemplateVars`. Comment if you think "`actionMailSendTemplatesVariablesPrepareAfter`" would be a better name!
 * In PR 2905, core dev julienboudreau introduced a much improved invoice template! The template is now split into multiple sub-templates (which can be overridden), there is a new zone for legal free text (along with the `displayInvoiceLegalFreeText` hook), and made it much better looking! Also, the options for images in PDF moved from Preferences > orders to Orders > Invoices and Orders > credit slips. Let us know what you think of it!
 * In PR 2900, core dev jeromenadaud introduced a new check, to display a warning if the server uses a PHP version below 5.4.
 * In PR 2967, core dev Shudrum removed the order\_changed.html/.txt e-mail template, and replaced it with the new `actionOrderEdited` hook. This follows [PR 13](https://github.com/PrestaShop/mailalerts/pull/13) on the `mailalerts` module, which introduces two new mails: return\_slip and order\_changed. Explore those changes!

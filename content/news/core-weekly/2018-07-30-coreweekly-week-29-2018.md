## General messages

Dear Community, after some time of vacation under the sun of Ile de Ré 🏝 🌅 😎, I am back!

While traditionally the summer is a quite calm period, developers are still very active on the PrestaShop project. While you are maybe packing your luggage, [PrestaShop 1.7.4.2](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-4-2-maintenance-release/) has been released last Friday. And if you want to upgrade, you can try the Beta 5 of the [Autoupgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases). Your feedback is of course very appreciated as usual.

Some of you may have seen a new quick tool in the comments, "phppsinfo.php": it is still in development, with the target of helping you fine tune your server, or to check all the important prerequisites before installing PrestaShop. Stay tuned, we will publish it soon on the main PrestaShop GitHub repository. And of course, it should be open for improvements too.

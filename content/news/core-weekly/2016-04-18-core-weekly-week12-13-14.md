This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last few weeks, from Monday 21st to Sunday 10th of April 2016.


## Milestones

Sorry for the delay! We were busy, well, you know, releasing the [first public alpha version of PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-alpha-3-is-here/), and a maintenance release for the 1.6 branch, [version 1.6.1.5](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1615-maintenance-release/).

Do you live near Paris? Are you willing to give us a couple of hours in order to test-drive the design of PS 1.7? [Let us know!](http://build.prestashop.com/news/call-for-user-testing-volunteers/)

The team is hard at work on PrestaShop 1.7, the next major version of the most complete e-commerce software solution there is. <br/>
You can find an up-to-date thread about it [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

_Please note that finishing the [planned projects for 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/meet-prestashop-team-prestashop-1-7/) and delivering a quality beta version soon is the top priority for the PrestaShop Core developers at the moment. Merging community pull requests has therefore slowed down until then, but will be back_ with a vengeance _once we have a first beta to release to you! So please keep testing, and keep sending patches our way: it's the_ raison d'Ãªtre _of this community project!_

Do you want to encourage us? **[Give us a star on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop)**! :)

<i>And with that, I'm taking two weeks off to celebrate my wedding! Cheers, good people! Don't break the Internet while I'm away :)<br/>
(yes, that means the next Core Weekly will also be 2-3 weeks late -- unless @AlexEven does something about it ;) )</i>

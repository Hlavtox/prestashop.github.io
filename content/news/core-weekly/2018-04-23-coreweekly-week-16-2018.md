## General messages

Last week, Pablo and many colleagues attended the PrestaShop Day in Madrid. More than 1,000 merchants, agencies, freelances and other enthusiasts gathered in La Nave conference center. We do hope you enjoyed it as much as we did, it was great, thanks! If you are French, don't forget to register for [PrestaShop Day Paris in June](https://prestashopday.com/fr/): this will be a great opportunity to learn what's new about PrestaShop and discuss with the community. If you are in Lyon, there is a local event the 15th of May: [Dejital Day](https://dejital.itis-commerce.com/). I will be there and I will enjoy meeting some of you in real life.

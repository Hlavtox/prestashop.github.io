This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during last week, from Monday 19th of October to Sunday 25th of October.


## Milestones

After four RCs version, [we released PrestaShop 1.6.1.2](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1612-maintenance-release/)! It's most notable is to solve the Product page slowness issue: let us know how that works for you!<br/>
Incidentally, that explains the lack of activity on this version that week :)

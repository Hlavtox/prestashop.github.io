## General messages

[Only 5 PRs merged last week](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20merged%3A2017-05-01..2017-05-07): that's not just because Labor Day came by, oh no! Most of the work towards 1.7.2.0 is going into PRs that will be merged once they're done:

* [#7631](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/7631) is where you can see grow the new Stock Management page.
* [#7835](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/7835) brings most #7631's findings (most notably Vue.js) into... a rework of the Translation page! Yup!

Both works are done in parallel, and the team is learning much about it, so that this will eventually have an impact on other back office pages.

You can have a look at both, but please understand that nothing is stable yet: wait for the forthcoming beta version before you really dive into it!

In the meantime, you can contribute feedback on Right-to-Left best practices on [the dedicated Trello board](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/).

Cheers!

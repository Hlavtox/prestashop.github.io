Wanna join in on the contribution fun, but don't know where to start? We're organizing a Contribution Night right in our Paris office in mid-June, the day before the PrestaShop Day. [Let's meet](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-night-barcamp-prestashop-day-paris-2017/)! A great way to [learn more about Open Source](http://build.prestashop.com/news/being-in-an-open-source-community/)... and [how to rebase in Git](http://build.prestashop.com/news/rebasing-your-git-branch/) :)

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 27th of March to Sunday 2nd of April 2017.


## General messages

PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 was released last Monday! Yay!<br/>
Of course this means that maaaaany people will only now start test-driving this new minor version, and therefore it's "fixing newfound issues" time! We are planning for a quick 1.7.1.1 release, with some much-needed fixes. Expect it soon!<br/>
Do you see issues? [Please report them](http://forge.prestashop.com/)!

Likewise, the 1-Cick Upgrade module [is still in Beta](http://build.prestashop.com/news/updated-1-click-upgrade-module/), and fixes are being made to ensure that the final version works in the most common situations. Please bear with us while we fix the reported issues.

Work continues on 1.7.2.0 (to be released in June, if all goes well), and you can see the reworked Stock Management feature being built [in this PR](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/7631), most notably.

Finally, version 1.6.1.13 should be released by the end of the month: [the milestone is 94% done](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/19?closed=1) :)

See you next week!

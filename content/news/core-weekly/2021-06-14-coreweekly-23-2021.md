## General messages

Dear developers,

[PrestaShop 1.7.7.5](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-5-maintenance-release/) was released on June 14, 2021. This maintenance release fixes 19 bugs reported on previous 1.7.7 versions.

We also celebrate two other notable releases from past week: [Linklist](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_linklist) module v5.0.0 and... [PHP 8.1 Alpha 1](https://www.php.net/archive/2021.php#2021-06-10-1)!

By the way, [PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 beta was released 2 weeks ago now](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-beta-release/). Have you tested it yet? Remember that only two weeks are left in the beta phase. The next step is the Release Candidate (RC) â€“ any bugs found at RC stage will delay the final release date. Now is the best time to look for issues!

## General messages

Dear Developers,

Last week, two new repositories have been added to the PrestaShop project on GitHub:

- [PhpPsInfo](https://github.com/PrestaShop/php-ps-info/), a tool to check if a server has all Apache and PHP prerequisites before starting to install a PrestaShop online store on it
- [Circuit Breaker](https://github.com/PrestaShop/circuit-breaker/), a library that allows applications to better handle cases when third party services (payment solutions, solutions using the webservices/API, Addons, ...) go offline. It will be progressively introduced in PrestaShop and its modules.

As usual, your feedback is welcome.

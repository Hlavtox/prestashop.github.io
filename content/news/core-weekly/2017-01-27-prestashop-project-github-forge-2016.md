Following up on both [last Friday's HNY post](http://build.prestashop.com/news/happy-new-year/) and [last Monday's lookback on the translation project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-translation-project-2016/), here's an infographic presenting a few stats on the PrestaShop project, from GitHub and the Forge!

This visual look back on the [PrestaShop GitHub project](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/) and the 1.7 Project on our Forge bugtracker is a way to present the contribution from the community to the improvement of this e-commerce solution. In comparison to the HNY numbers, we added a couple of Forge tidbits.

Thank you all for your involvement :)

A couple more stats didn't make in time for the infographic:

* In 2016, the community created 785 tickets on the 1.7 Project.
* 178 of those community-created tickets are still to be addressed -- of which only 23 are blocking/critical/major tickets.

We keep working on handled PRs and Forge tickets better. Expect good things from 2017!

Once again, this lovely design was made by our very own[Tristan Lehot](https://twitter.com/TristanDardel), Product Designer at PrestaShop.

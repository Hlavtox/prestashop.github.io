## General messages

Dear Developers,

Last week, part of the PrestaShop team's developers attended the PHP Forum in Paris. It is a good event to discover what's new with the technology and learn new skills. However, it has had an impact on productivity: fewer pull requests have been merged than usual.

The recent upgrade of PrestaShop's APIs infrastructures improved the overall performance of stores back office. In parallel, the Gamification module has been improved too. A new release is available, for both 1.6 and 1.7 versions of PrestaShop:

* All static files are included in the module, in order to remove a lot of requests to the servers
* The json data requested by the module is compressed and so up to 90% lighter in order to decrease the bandwidth
* Some users reported an issue with very old versions of PHP; a fix is currently being tested and another release is expected soon, but please keep in mind that for your shop security and performance, you should use a supported version of PHP
* You can follow the work about the [Gamification module on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/gamification).

By the way, thanks a lot for the feedback on GitHub. It helps a lot to improve the PrestaShop open source project.

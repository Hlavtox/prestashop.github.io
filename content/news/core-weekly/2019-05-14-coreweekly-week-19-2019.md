## General messages

Dear Developers,

In case you missed it, [1.7.6 beta has been released yesterday](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-6-0-beta-release/). It's time to test it, to test your modules and themes with it, and [open a new issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) if needed. Also, of course, your help is welcome to fix issues.

Please add the date to your agenda: [PSD Paris 2019](https://www.prestashop.com/fr/evenements/prestashop-day-paris) will be in a couple of weeks, the 4th of June 2019, at Palais Brongniart, Paris, France. Like each year, this is the opportunity for the PrestaShop ecosystem to meet together and learn what's new with great talks and speakers. 

And, also, this year, there will be a dedicated "developer area". This will be the place to meet other tech people of the community, including the PrestaShop company developers. Come with your laptop, and let's fix bugs and merge pull requests together. I will publish a dedicated news on the blog when more information will be available.

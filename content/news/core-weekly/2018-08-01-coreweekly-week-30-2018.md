## General messages

Dear Developers, in this news, I would like to highlight the work done in July on labels, for [PrestaShop's main GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels). Most fields/values from Jira tickets have now an equivalent with a label name. And they have been grouped using colors and descriptions. E.g: [Priority](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=priority), [Component](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=component) or [Category](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=category).

Of course, on short term, this will improve the sorting of pull requests. However, this is also a preparation in order to be able to sort GitHub issues, when they will be enabled. Stay tuned, an article on this blog will be published soon about this much expected move.

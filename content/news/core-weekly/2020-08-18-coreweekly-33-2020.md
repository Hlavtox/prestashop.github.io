## General messages

Dear developers,

As announced on [Release 1.7.7.0 tracking issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18647#issuecomment-672940163), it has been decided to issue a second beta build that contains all fixes merged since Beta 1. Over 130 PRs have been merged to branch `1.7.7.x` and we want to provide the community with a more up to date version to continue testing, while giving ourselves more time to continue squashing bugs.

We're targeting a Beta 2 to be released on September 1st. This will be followed by an RC early October at the latest.

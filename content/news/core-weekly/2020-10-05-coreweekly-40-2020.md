## General messages

Dear developers,

The past week has been filled with lot of interesting events!

First, [PHP 8.0 Release Candidate 1](https://www.php.net/archive/2020.php#2020-10-01-4) has been delivered and is available for testing. Obviously, we suggest helping the test of this version as this is the future of PHP.

Secondly, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) has started on the 1st of October. But the very first days of the event have been complicated: the event [experimented a huge spam contributions wave](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update). The consequences of this spam are that the rules of Hacktoberfest changed on the 3rd of October: projects now need to opt-in for the event and Pull Requests must be either merged, approved, or labeled 'hacktoberfest-accepted' to be accepted as a participation.

The PrestaShop team has decided to opt-in to this event so your (valid) contributions will be acknowledged as participations for this edition of the Hacktoberfest!

Finally, the QA team is still running the test campaign on the Release Candidate 1 build delivered the week before.

## General messages

Dear Developpers,

The [Auto upgrade module is available in version 4.5.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.5.0). The memory use when downloading releases has been optimized.

I will be at [Paris Open Source Summit next week](https://www.opensourcesummit.paris/), and I will speak about [PrestaShop, open source and business models](https://inno3.fr/actualite/track-modeles-daffaires-de-lopen-source-poss-2018). If you are planning to be there too, let's meet, discuss, and maybe why not have a beer together?


## A quick update about GitHub issues

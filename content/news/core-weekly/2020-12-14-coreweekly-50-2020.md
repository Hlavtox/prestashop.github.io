## General messages

Dear developers,

We're three weeks away from the end of the year, and a patch release has been scheduled for PrestaShop 1.7.7. [PrestaShop 1.7.7.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/22306) is expected to be delivered in the middle of January 2021.

It would be a lie to say this was not expected: as PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 was such a large release, it would have been an amazing stroke of luck to land it without bugs!

Work on 1.7.7.1 will be carried out during the month of December, and the testing of the release will happen in early January 2021 so it can be released, hopefully, in the second week of January.

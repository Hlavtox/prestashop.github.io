This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 27th of February to Sunday 5th of March 2017.


## General messages

As I am sure you are aware, [PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 Beta 1 was released last week](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-beta-1/)! We need you to test it and help us make sure it's a solid version by [reporting issues](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) and [providing pull-requests for bugfixes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/1.7.1.x). Thank you!

Being on the track to release 1.7.1.0 means one thing very specific to our GitHub contributor: branch updates! Since last week:

* The 'develop' branch is used to work on the next minor version, 1.7.2.0!
* Work on 1.7.1.0 is now done in the '1.7.1.x' branch. 
  * This is also where pull requests for 1.7.1.0's patch versions (1.7.1.1, 1.7.1.2, etc.) should be made
* Work on 1.7.0.6 (the recent security fix) was done in the '1.7.0.x' branch.
* As usuel, the '1.6.1.x' branch remains the one to choose when fixing bugs for PrestaShop 1.6.

This means that if you know how to fix an issue with 1.7.1.0 Beta 1, you should make your pull request on the '1.7.1.x' branch, NOT on 'develop'. Thank you!

If you can't find any issue (yay!) or if you don't know how to fix issues, you can still contribute by [helping with the translation for 1.7.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/171-Translations-update/) :)


## Code changes in 'develop' branch (for the next minor version, v1.7.2.0)

Note that 1.7 patch versions are being built in the '1.7.0.x' branch. All of the PRs from that branch are eventually ported in the 'develop' branch.

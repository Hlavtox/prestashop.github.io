This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the previous week, from Monday 4th to Sunday 10th of July 2016.


## General messages

We're getting real close to a Beta 2 release! Are you ready? :)

Have you [tried one of your modules in 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/module-development-changes-in-17/)? Have you tried to create a 1.7 theme? How did it go?<br/>
[Give us your feedback](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-1-open-for-feedback/)!

Want to help things go faster? There are several ways: 

 * [Test the Beta version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-1-open-for-feedback/) (or better, test [the current development version, straight from GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop));
 * [Report issues on the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) (or [confirm issues that are already listed](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-738?jql=project%20%3D%20BOOM%20AND%20created%3E%3D-1w%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) - use the search engine!); 
 * Fix issues by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) (or confirm that a submitted pull request does indeed fix the presented issue); 
 * Help improve the [1.7 tech documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) (both for themes and modules), with issues and pull requests.

You can find an up-to-date thread about the 1.7 development [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

Do you live near Paris? Do you want to come test-drive the design of PS 1.7? [Let us know!](http://build.prestashop.com/news/call-for-user-testing-volunteers/)

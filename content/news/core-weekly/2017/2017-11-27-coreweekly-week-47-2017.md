## General messages

Last week was rather quiet : five PRs have been merged. But don't get disapointed, it is only because we are working hard on version 1.7.3 and its impending release... it is all about one word: stabilization!

Last call: Build needs your opinion! While we're always feeding you with tech news from the dev team, this time we would like you to feed us with your points of view and opinions. We have opened a survey [there](http://build.prestashop.com/news/uncle-build-wants-you) to help us getting sharper on topics that matter to you. Is this devblog satisfying enough your expectations and needs? Allow us to rethink Build altogether!

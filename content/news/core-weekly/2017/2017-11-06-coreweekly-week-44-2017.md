## General messages

Pretty big week for pull requests! A lot of improvement has been made on GitHub for the source code of PrestaShop to get better, more powerful... Speaking of it, we published a quick interview last week, introducing [David-Julian Buch](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-interview-david-julian-buch), one of our contributor, who declares contributing to PrestaShop through GitHub "helps me contributing to Open Source projects as well as enhancing in-house development process". And it's a nice thing to hear!

As for Crowdin, the last edition of our montly translation report should be put online in the next few days to keep you posted about how PrestaShop evolved in October. Stay tuned because a lot has been done lately, thanks to all contributors!

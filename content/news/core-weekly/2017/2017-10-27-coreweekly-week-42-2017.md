## General messages

Lots of news lately! We made a quick interview of Sullivan Sénéchal, one of PrestaShop's contributor, in which he talks about his work on open-source projects and also explains why he got involved with PrestaShop.

Our September edition of the translation report is online and the result is : translation and validation keep on making projects grow, especially in the Korean and Spanish, Mexico languages, and that is great news... thanks!

Last but not least, PrestaShop 1.7.2.4 is available since some leaks has been spotted in versions 1.7.1.0 to 1.7.2.3. So we strongly advise you to get this version as soon as possible, it will help avoiding these issues.

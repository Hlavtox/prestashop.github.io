## General messages

Again, a lot has been done this past week. And a lot is to come, especially the hooks of the product page which are under examination to be improved ! Most important information is that we migrated to Symfony 3, it has been merged in the 'develop' branch last week. Therefore our best advice is to update your PHP version because you will need at least PHP 5.6 for our version 1.7.4. It is better now than never !

Regarding PHP, and the AFUP's annual conference, the good news is that all lectures has been put online on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/afupPHP/videos). You don't know which one to pick and watch ? Have a look at @tomlev's choice, he introduced last Friday one of the great lectures he has been attended there : [Is it necessary to make quality work?](http://build.prestashop.com/news/video-from-php-forum-with-love), by Jean-François Lépine.

## General messages

Say hello to the 1.7.3 beta 1 version, available [here](https://www.prestashop.com/en/release-notes-1-7-3-0-beta) and waiting for you to be tested! It is a first achievement towards a fully stabilized version, some features (like the RTL) are still under construction to be debugged. It is because we are still working on improving the 1.7.3 that we have decided to release a beta instead of a RC. Anyway, we would love to have your feedback on it, let us know on the [Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1).

One last (great) information, the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) community extends itself again last week, the [Greenlandic project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/kl#) is now available for translation. Come and help us on it too!

Also, it is time for us to disclose the results of the [survey](http://build.prestashop.com/news/uncle-build-wants-you) submitted a month ago. We can't wait learning about you people and drawing the right conclusions to head to a more pertinent devblog, useful for everybody who needs it. What a beautiful intention, right?

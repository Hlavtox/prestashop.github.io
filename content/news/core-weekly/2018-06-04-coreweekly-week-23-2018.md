## General messages

Great news: we have never been so close to publish the 1.7.4 beta! Among its new features is the refactoring of the Auto Upgrade module, it is one of the key improvements we want to bring with this release. Help our dev team, have a look at it, test it and give us some feedback:

* [Documentation is a public Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bntisRK5V_v-1nrR5_GY1r6nnz_tPZPC2u5MfjUVIE/edit?usp=sharing), therefore it is open to feedback, it will help us improve it
* Download the [4.0.0-beta.1 version of the Auto Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.1) on GitHub 

** Please do not use it on a production website and of course, backup, backup, and backup first.**

To conclude, we hope to see you at the PrestaShop Day this Thursday. There is an "open source corner", let's meet and chat there. :-)

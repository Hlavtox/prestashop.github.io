This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the previous three weeks, from Monday 23rd of May to Sunday 12th of June 2016.


## Milestones

We released [PrestaShop 1.7 Beta 1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-1-open-for-feedback/)!<br/>
We also released [PrestaShop 1.6.1.6](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1616-maintenance-release/)!<br/>
We published an article about the [module development changes in PrestasShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/module-development-changes-in-17/)!<br/>
We also published the [PrestaShop Translator Guide](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/translation/new-translator-guide-available-now/) AND the [PrestaShop Contributor Guide](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/contribute-to-prestashop/)!<br/>
We even told [how the new default theme was designed](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Designing-the-new-PrestaShop-default-theme/)!<br/>
The days are just PACKED! :)

Want to help things go faster? There are several ways: 

 * [Test the Beta version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-1-open-for-feedback/) (or better, test [the current development version, straight from GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop));
 * [Report issues on the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) (or [confirm issues that are already listed](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-738?jql=project%20%3D%20BOOM%20AND%20created%3E%3D-1w%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) - use the search engine!); 
 * Fix issues by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) (or confirm that a submitted pull request does indeed fix the presented issue); 
 * Help improve the [1.7 Theme Development doc](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) (yes, it is very sparse at the moment).

You can find an up-to-date thread about the 1.7 development [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

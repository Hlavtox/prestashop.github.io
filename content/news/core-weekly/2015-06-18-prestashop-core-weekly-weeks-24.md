This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last two weeks, from Monday 8th to Sunday 14th of June, 2015.


## Milestones

The Core team is working on version 1.6.1.0, and the fourth Release Candidate version still needs some testing! [Read all about it here](/news/prestashop-1.6.1.0-rc4/)!

It was a short week, since last Thursday we organized the PrestaShop Day in Paris ([see the official report here](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/prestashopday-recapping-amazing-event/)), and the whole team was attending and even presenting workshops for potential contributors and partners. We hope you learnt a lot! We will try to publish the slides of our workshops very soon right here on the Build PrestaShop devblog.

As a reminder, we recently chose to [change our Coding Standards to PSR-2](/news/prestashop-moves-to-psr-2/), and to [adopt a SemVer-like versioning scheme](/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/).

Of note among the merged PRs last week:

 * In PR 3155, Core developer Maxime Bilo√© (maximebiloe) added a button to re-send the order email from the Orders page.
 * In PR 3158, Core developer Julien Bourdeau (julienbourdeau) updated the way invoices are generated after receiving feedback.

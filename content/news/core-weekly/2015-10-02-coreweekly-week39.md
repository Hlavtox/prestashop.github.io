This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during last week, from Monday 21st of September to Sunday 27th.


## Milestones

The current stable version of PrestaShop is [version 1.6.1.1 of PrestaShop](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1611-maintenance-release/), and last week we released the Release Candidate for the second [patch version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/) of branch 1.6.1.x: [we need you to test that v1.6.1.2 RC1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-2-rc1/) is ready for production and does indeed fix the closed issues! An RC2 should make its way very soon.

Meanwhile, the team is hard at work on version 1.7.0.0, and we published some information on this blog already:

 * [Initial launch of 1.7.0.0 project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/version-1-7-0-0-is-underway/).
 * [Starter Theme collaborative project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-kickoff/).
 * [Recent technological changes in 1.7.0.0 codebase](http://build.prestashop.com/news/cldr-composer-jshint/): CLDR, Composer, JSHint, etc.

More information are coming soon, among which explanation of where we aim to take the [new architecture that was introduced in v1.6.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-architecture-1-6-1-0/), and details about some forthcoming design changes.

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during last two weeks, from Monday 7th to Sunday 13th of December.


## Milestones

A couple of major articles recently landed on the Build devblog. They contain fresh information about 1.7.0.0, so if you missed them, here they are:

 * [An update on the 1.7 architecture](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-and-symfony/): Why we are choosing to move the codebase to Symfony2, and how we plan on doing it.
 * [Starter Theme: fresh news from the front #3](http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-news-3/): Part 3 of our series of articles about the Starter Theme.
 
Additionnally, [we are hiring more developers](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestacrew-hiring/)!

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 23rd to Sunday 29th of January 2017.


## General messages

It's business time as usual at PrestaShop: fixing issues, closing Forge tickets, and preparing for what's to come in 2017 for v1.7 and v1.6! Expect a release calendar in the coming days ;)

Notable PRs merged last week are:

* #7291 finally brings the codebase to 2017!
* Thanks to @martinfojtik, absent CMS pages correctly return a 404.
* CSV Export files can be properly opened in Excel. Phew! Demo CSV files have been updated accordingly.
* and several fixes!

Found an issue in PrestaShop 1.7? [Create a Forge ticket](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1)! Every day at around 11:30 (Paris time), part of the team gathers in order to review the recent Forge tickets and assess their priorities and urgency. Thank you for your contribution!



## Code changes in 'develop' branch (for the next minor version, v1.7.1.0)

Let's review the merged pull-requests on the ['develop' branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) since the last Core Weekly Report!

Note that 1.7 patch versions are being built in the '1.7.0.x' branch. All of the PRs from that branch are eventually ported in the 'develop' branch.

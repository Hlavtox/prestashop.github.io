## General messages

I would like to start this news with a big THANK YOU GUYS !!!
The [Auto Upgrade module version 4.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.0.0) has been released after 5 betas. It could not have been done without all the feedback from the community users and developers. Really, thanks a lot again. Everyone should now see this version in the Back Office of their PrestaShop store. 

We are currently writing a dedicated article about this new version: what it does and does not, how, and what it will do. Stay tuned.

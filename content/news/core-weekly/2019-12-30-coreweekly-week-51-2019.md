## General messages

Dear Developers,

Happy holidays! Pablo Borowicz, PrestaShop's lead developer, [published the third part](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-in-2019-and-beyond-part-3-the-future-architecture/) of his [series about the architecture of the PrestaShop open source project](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-in-2019-and-beyond-introduction/) as a present for you ;) .

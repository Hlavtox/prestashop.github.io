## General messages

Dear Developers,

New year is coming soon. We expect the activity on GitHub to slow down a bit as some people take time off for holidays. This is also true for for maintainers, product and QA teams.

[PrestaShop 1.7.7.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/22306) is on track and quality continues to increase on PrestaShop core as [PHPStan](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/21515) is now analyzing PrestaShop code under level 4 thanks to [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984).

By the way, did you notice the new design and features of the [Contributors page](https://contributors.prestashop.com/)?

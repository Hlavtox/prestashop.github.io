## General messages

Dear Developers,

A new repository is now active with a very interesting and awaited content: specifications. Still a work in progress, the product management team from the PrestaShop company has started to publish specifications and other important information about "how it should works". The target is to give more resources to developers and contributors in general.

And of course, like all resources on the GitHub repositories, this is possible to add links to the specifications in issues and pull requests. This will ease the general project management.

The URL to this new repository:  
https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs

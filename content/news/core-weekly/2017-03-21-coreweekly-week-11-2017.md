This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 13th of Sunday 19th of March 2017.


## General messages

Version 1.7.1.0 is getting closer! You can [contribute to the localization](http://build.prestashop.com/news/171-Translations-update/), and discover the [new and updated hooks](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-updated-hooks-1-7-1-0/)!

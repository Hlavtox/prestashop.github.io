## General messages

Dear Developers,

The team is currently working on a Beta release. If you are interested to follow the work on the 1.7.6, below are three interesting links on GitHub:

- The [1.7.6 roadmap](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/4), this is a dedicated kanban used for the release's project management
- The [1.7.6.0 milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/47), where you can see what is currently open, and the work already closed (more than 800 items to date)
- You can also filter by type: [issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.7.6.0+) (208 closed + open to date) or [pull requests](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.6.0) (635 closed + open to date)

If you want to compare, below are the equivalent links for two previous releases:

- [1.7.5.0 milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/41?closed=1), with 596 items, including [146 issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.7.5.0) and [450 pull requests](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.5.0)
- [1.7.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/34), with 260 pull requests; issues were still managed on the old forge at this time, that explains why there are no figures for issues.

So, now, you know how to check that PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 will be a huge release!

And that doesn't include the work carried out for the modules: this is only for the core. You can find some inspiration from the links in the next section of this core weekly to track the work done on the entire project.

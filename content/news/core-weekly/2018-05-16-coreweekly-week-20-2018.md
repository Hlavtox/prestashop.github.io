## General messages

Dear all, we would like to thank you for the huge amount of feedback about the GDPR module. Lots of comments on our blog posts, tweets, support tickets, etc. So much we can't list everything here! In the open source world, we often say that a bug report is like a love letter. If so, we're glad to see all this love for the PrestaShop project ;-)

I would like to assure you that our teams are doing their best to take everything into account and to improve the GDPR module consequently. In other words, you can expect some updates this week...

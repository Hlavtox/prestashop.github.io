This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last few weeks, from Monday 11th of April to Sunday 1st of May 2016.


## Milestones

Since the last Core Weekly Report, we released [alpha 4 of PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/here-comes-prestashop-1-7-alpha-4/). Give us your feedback!

We also recently released a maintenance version for the 1.6 branch, [version 1.6.1.5](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1615-maintenance-release/).

Do you live near Paris? Do you want to come test-drive the design of PS 1.7? [Let us know!](http://build.prestashop.com/news/call-for-user-testing-volunteers/)

The team is hard at work on PrestaShop 1.7, the next major version of the most complete e-commerce software solution there is. <br/>
You can find an up-to-date thread about it [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

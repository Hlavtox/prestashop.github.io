## General messages

Dear Developers,

You will notice that the GDPR module has been improved thanks to a contributor from the community. As improving modules is sometimes easier than to improve the PrestaShop project's core, this is a very good way to start to contribute. Just have a look at the [Native modules integration](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/5) kanban on GitHub, and pick something up in the todo list.

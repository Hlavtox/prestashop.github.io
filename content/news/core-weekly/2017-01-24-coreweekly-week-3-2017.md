This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last weeks, from Monday 16th to Sunday 22nd of January 2017.


## General messages

Work continues on improving the 1.7.0.x branch, all the while preparing for a strong 1.7.1.0 release -- and maintaining the 1.6.1.x branch!

Look forward to v1.7.0.5 and v1.6.1.12 in the coming weeks! :)

Found an issue? [Create a Forge ticket](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1)! Every day at around 11:30 (Paris time), part of the team gathers in order to review the recent Forge tickets and assess their priorities and urgency. Let's get productive!



## Code changes in 'develop' branch (for version 1.7.1.0)

Let's review the merged pull-requests on the ['develop' branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) since the last Core Weekly Report!

Note that 1.7 patch versions are being built in the '1.7.0.x' branch. All of the PRs from that branch are ported in the 'develop' branch.

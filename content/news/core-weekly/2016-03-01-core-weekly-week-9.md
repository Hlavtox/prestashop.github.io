This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 29th of February to Sunday 6th of March 2016.


## Milestones

Pull request with notable information this week:

 * [5080](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/5080): Introduces a brand new template for your pull request. Improve your PR by following the presented best-practices!
 * [5105](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/5105): Introduces a way to display the template name within the markup, in order to help find the problematic template.
 * [5115](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/5115): Since jQzoom and FancyBox have been removed, this removes their back office option.
 

The team is hard at work on PrestaShop 1.7, the next major version of the most complete e-commerce software solution there is. You can find an up-to-date thread about it [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).

_Please note that finishing the [planned projects for 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/meet-prestashop-team-prestashop-1-7/) and delivering a quality beta version soon is the top priority for the PrestaShop Core developers at the moment. Merging community pull requests has therefore slowed down until then, but will be back_ with a vengeance _once we have a first beta to release to you! So please keep testing, and keep sending patches our way: it's the_ raison d'Ãªtre _of this community project!_

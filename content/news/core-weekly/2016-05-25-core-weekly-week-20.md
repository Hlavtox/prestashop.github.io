This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the previous week, from Monday 16th to Sunday 22th of May 2016.


## Milestones

Come and meet us in Paris on June 1st & 2nd!<br/>
We're organizing [two events](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-night-barcamp-prestashop-day/) along the PrestaShop Day:

 * June 1st: a **contributor night** in our Paris office. Want to contribute or learn how to contribute? [Register here](https://docs.google.com/a/prestashop.com/forms/d/1O60GhRFICbnt3TxZ3Hrne-TcHIoeEDLATcVD7XXNeYg/viewform)!
 * June 2nd: a **community barcamp** within the walls of the PSDay. Have something to share about PrestaShop or e-commerce? [Let us know here](https://docs.google.com/a/prestashop.com/forms/d/12hOjfnGaFuzdlD_BIpm3bU_2Qf6aBYbdUgYNN4SBEvI/viewform)!

See you there!

The work being done on version 1.7.0.0 is still going strong, working towards a proper first Beta!<br/>
In the meantime, the 1.6 branch is being supported, as expected, and you should soon see 1.6.1.6 be released :)

Want to help things go faster? There are several ways: 

 * [Test the latest alpha version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/here-comes-prestashop-1-7-alpha-4/) (or better, test [the current development version, straight from GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop));
 * [Report issues on the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) (or [confirm issues that are already listed](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-738?jql=project%20%3D%20BOOM%20AND%20created%3E%3D-1w%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) - use the search engine!); 
 * Fix issues by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) (or confirm that a submitted pull request does indeed fix the presented issue); 
 * Help improve the [1.7 Theme Development doc](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) (yes, it is very sparse at the moment).

You can find an up-to-date thread about the 1.7 development [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

Do you live near Paris? Do you want to come test-drive the design of PS 1.7? [Let us know!](http://build.prestashop.com/news/call-for-user-testing-volunteers/)

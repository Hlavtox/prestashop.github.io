This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last three weeks, from Monday 28th of December 2015 to Sunday 17th of January 2016.

Happy new year to you, dear contributors and community members! The Core Weekly report took a bit of a holiday in early January, but we're back on track now! :)


## Milestones

The team is hard at work on PrestaShop 1.7, the next major version of the most complete e-commerce software solution there is.

This new version introduces several new things that were written about in this very blog, and you can find a summary of that [in the forum post](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/)! More content coming soon.

Our product managers talk about the various projects [in these videos](http://build.prestashop.com/news/meet-prestashop-team-prestashop-1-7/).

The readers of this devblog know most of these, but since this is the new year, here is the overview of what is being worked on for 1.7:

 * Global UX/UI rework.
 * [New architecture based on Symfony 2.8](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-and-symfony/).
 * Rework of the Product page.
 * [Rework of the Modules page](http://build.prestashop.com/news/module-page-awakens/).
 * [Rework of the Theme API and new Starter Theme](http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-kickoff/).
 * New default theme, based on the Starter Theme.
 
That last item has just started taking life! **The development of the new default theme has begun!** Right now, it is named Classic and its development is going strong. You too can contribute ideas and code: development happens on the [feat/classic branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/feat/classic) This theme will follow changes on the [feat/starter-theme](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/feat/starter-theme) branch. If you want to know the technological choices: Bootstrap 4 Sass version, Bourbon, ES6, all built with webpack. You can discuss it [on the dedicated Gitter channel](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme): come work with us to make it a reality!

See all the PRs merged into the codebase since the last Core Weekly [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2015-12-28..2016-01-17+is%3Aclosed+).

Thank you to the contributors whose pull requests were merged since the last Core Weekly Report: @firstred, @@prestamodule, and @Nobodaddy! Also, thank you to the contributors whose PRs haven't been merged yet! And of course, a big thank you to all those who contribute with tickets on the Forge!

_Please note that finishing our projects for 1.7 and delivering a quality beta version soon is at the moment the top priority for our developers. Merging community pull requests has therefore slowed down until then, but will be back with a vengeance once we have a first beta to release to you! So please keep testing, and keep send patches our way: it's the_ raison d'être _of this community project!_

...and we're back for another Core Weekly report!
As you can see, we've moved to the Build.PrestaShop blog, which is where all dev activity will be talked about, for and with the Community!

As always, this Core Weekly report highlight changes in PrestaShop core codebase last week, from Monday 30th of March to Sunday 5th of April.

The Core Weekly report is ever evolving, so if you have ideas on how to improve it, let me know!

## Milestones

Well, we launched the Build.PrestaShop devblog, which you are reading right now. This is a big step towards the community (developers, designers, or just the curious ones), which we've been meaning to make for a long time, and we're very happy to have this place to exchange with you!

The PSR-2 survey is still running, give us your opinion! [https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/)

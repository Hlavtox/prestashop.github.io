This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 3rd to Sunday 9th of April 2017.


## General messages

As expected, we have received a lot of feedback from the community as soon as PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 was released. The team has been working hard at fixing the most critical issue, and we are already testing v1.7.1.1, to be released soon.<br/>
Do you see new issues? [Please report them](http://forge.prestashop.com/)!

We are also launching a new initiative with the community: we want to drastically improve RTL support in PrestaShop, and if you work with RTL languages and have technical knowledge on how to best implement it, [join the Trello board](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/)!

Finally, PrestaShop 1.6's monthly update is near: the [1.6.1.13 milestone is at 100%](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/19?closed=1), and it's being tested by our QA team! :)

See you next week!

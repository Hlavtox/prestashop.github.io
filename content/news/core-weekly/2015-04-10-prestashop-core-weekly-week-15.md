Welcome to Week 15 in PrestaShop Core development! This is the Core Weekly!

As a reminder, this Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase last week, from Monday 6th to Sunday 12th of April, 2015.

The Core Weekly report is ever evolving, so if you have ideas on how to improve it, let me know!

## Milestones

The PSR-2 survey is still running, give us your opinion! [https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/)

Cool things are boiling, but we'll keep that for another blogpost :)

## General messages

Dear developers,

The [**first Release Candidate**](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-rc-release/) of PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 has finally been delivered yesterday, after multiple weeks spent carefully strengthening and stabilizing it. For the PrestaShop maintainers team, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) has been all about 1.7.7.0.

This Release Candidate is open for testing for two weeks. On October 18th, if no critical or major regression has been reported, PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 will be delivered as a stable version.

Please help us test this build to make sure this release is a success!

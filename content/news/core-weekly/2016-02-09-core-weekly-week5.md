This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 1st to Sunday 7th of February 2016.


## Milestones

The team is hard at work on PrestaShop 1.7, the next major version of the most complete e-commerce software solution there is. You can find an up-to-date thread about it [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).

_Please note that finishing the [planned projects for 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/meet-prestashop-team-prestashop-1-7/) and delivering a quality beta version soon is at the moment the top priority for the PrestaShop Core developers. Merging community pull requests has therefore slowed down until then, but will be back_ with a vengeance _once we have a first beta to release to you! So please keep testing, and keep sending patches our way: it's the_ raison d'Ãªtre _of this community project!_

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 30th of January to Sunday 5th of February 2017.


## General messages

If you haven't seen it yet, check out our [Release Schedule for 2017](http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-our-2017-release-schedule/): we are doing our best to regularly deliver new 1.7 and 1.6 versions all year long. The ultimate aim is to have, by year's end, 4 minor versions for v1.7, as well as monthly patch versions for both v1.7 and v1.6.

While we are mentioning patch versions for v1.7: who here wants 1.7.0.5 released? I know I do, and [those 29 merged PRs](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/18?closed=1) might whet your appetite :) See you soon!

Notable PRs merged last week are:

* So many more Smarty blocks! Check #7362 out!
* Email templates parent/child compatible, woohoo!
* Want more hooks? How about `actionDispatcherBefore`, `actionDispatcherAfter`, `actionOutputHTMLBefore`, `displayAfterProductThumb`, and `actionClearCache`?
* No more synchronous loading for TinyMCE.
* It's the little things that count: shared stock quantity are now displayed correctly, thanks to @amazzing!
* Goodbye for good, smartyDump()! Cheers @prestamodule :)

Found an issue in PrestaShop 1.7? [Create a Forge ticket](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1)! Every day at around 11:30 (Paris time), part of the team gathers in order to review the recent Forge tickets and assess their priorities and urgency. I'll post a photo if you want :) Thank you for your contribution! (and thank you for reading this text instead of directly going to the code changes ;) )



## Code changes in 'develop' branch (for the next minor version, v1.7.1.0)

Let's review the merged pull-requests on the ['develop' branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) since the last Core Weekly Report!

Note that 1.7 patch versions are being built in the '1.7.0.x' branch. All of the PRs from that branch are eventually ported in the 'develop' branch.

## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week, the maintainer team [presented](https://build.prestashop.com/news/new-theme-announce/) the new Front-office theme we are working on. At the same time we submitted a [poll](https://framaforms.org/vote-for-the-new-theme-name-1644576025) to choose the name of this new theme.

Don't hesitate to tell us your feedback on this project, to do so [join the discussion on slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/). The community is being regularly consulted there to make sure the new theme will meet the expectations and needs of everyone.

Also did you notice three security releases of PHP were published last week? PHP 8.1.3, PHP 8.0.16 and PHP 7.4.28 fix a vulnerability in input validation code. We encourage everybody to upgrade to these versions.

This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last two weeks, from Monday 18th of May to Sunday 31st of May, 2015.

May is a short/quick month in Paris, and I was quite absent in the last few days, while projects here were many. In short, sorry for the lateness of this edition of Core Weekly -- which consequently spans two weeks instead of one, again. Back to our normal schedule next week!


## Milestones

Version 1.6.1.0-rc3 was released last week! Help us test it! [Read all about it here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-0-rc3/)!

The [PSR-2 survey](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/434831-psr2-development-norm-for-prestashop/) is closed, and the participants chose to follow through! [Consequently, we're adopting PSR-2 from 1.6.1.0 onward](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-moves-to-psr-2/)!

Of note among the merged PRs in the last two weeks:

 * As announced in [a previous post on this blog](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-architecture-1-6-1-0/), the new architecture of PrestaShop is being worked on, and the first elements were merge into Core through PR 3053. A lot of thanks for djfm (François-Marie De Jouvencel), tchauviere (Thibaud Chauvière) and mdomenjoud (Michel Domenjoud) for the huge work that has been accomplished so far! There is still a long road to follow, and we call on the whole community to spread the word and help us achieve this goal!
 * In PR 3061, core developer sfroment42 (Sacha Froment) allowed the use of &lt;style&gt; in the email editor (TinyMCE).
 * In PR 3067, contributor frederic-benoist (Frédéric Benoist) added a cleanHtml modifier to Smarty Add in order to prevent XSS injections.

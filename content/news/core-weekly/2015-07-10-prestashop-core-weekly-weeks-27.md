This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last week, from Monday 29th of June to Sunday 5th of July, 2015.


## Milestones

[PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 has been released](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/delivering-new-improved-v1-6-1-0/)! Go [download the latest version of PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com/en/download), or read [our own little celebratory post](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1-6-1-0-released/)!

One important part of version 1.6.1.0 is the addition of the [Advanced EU Compliance module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/advancedeucompliance), which helps merchants make their shops compliant with the recent, more restrictive EU regulations. Want to learn why and how we built it? Read [Thibaud's article here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/advanced-eu-compliance/)!

Now that v1.6.1.0 is released, make sure to get acquainted with the project evolution that developers will soon be able to profit from: [dropping support for PHP 5.2 and 5.3](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Dropping-support-php52-and-53/), [benchmarking the performance improvements in 1.6.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-0-performances/), [switching to a more semantic versioning scheme](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/), [adopting the PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-moves-to-psr-2/), and, last but certainly not least, the [forthcoming architecture improvements](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-architecture-1-6-1-0/).

The team is already at work on the next versions of PrestaShop!

Of note among the merged PRs since the last Core Weekly Report:

 * We reached PR 3333, and Content Manager Alex Even won that PR :)
 * In PR 3283, Core developer Xavier Gouley update the Delivery, Order Return and Credit Slip PDF templates to fit with the new 1.6.1.0 template style.

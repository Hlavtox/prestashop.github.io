## General messages

We released version 1.6.1.7 in early September. It's a recommended upgrade for any 1.6 user, and a **must-update** for 1.6.1.6 users, since it fixes a possibly nasty issue with vouchers. Please, 1.6.1.6 users: upgrade now, and help your friends upgrade!

[Download 1.6.1.7 now!](https://www.prestashop.com/en/download){: .btn .btn-lg .btn-success}

As for 1.7, as you can see in the code changes for the develop branch, there has been A LOT of changes to 1.7 since RC0: many fixes, several improvements, and some cool new features as well. For instance, did you see that PrestaShop now features a child-theme system? [Read the early doc](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/blob/1e42706321e583623de60db3d6c314052d81415a/themes/smarty/parent-child-feature.rst), and try it out!

Are your modules 1.7-ready? Have a tried to create a 1.7 theme? [Check the current tech doc](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs)!

You can find an up-to-date thread about the 1.7 development [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>

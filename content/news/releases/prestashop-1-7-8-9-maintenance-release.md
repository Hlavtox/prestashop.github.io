Since version 1.7.8.9 is a "patch" update, upgrading from version 1.7.8.8 should happen without any issues.

Features will work better, and modules and themes, which worked fine on previous 1.7.8 release, will work just as well with 1.7.8.9. As for every upgrade, it's highly recommended to do a full manual backup beforehand.

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade that, in your opinion, are not caused by third-party modules or modifications used in your shop, [submit a bug report](https://www.prestashop-project.org/get-involved/report-issues/).

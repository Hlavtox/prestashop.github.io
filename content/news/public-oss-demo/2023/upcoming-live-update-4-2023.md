The fourth Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, April 12th, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_12_Apr_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbAQ__A6ns)!

Tomorrow we'll discuss what's going on in the project, show you recent changes in the developer documentation, and, most importantly, [@eternoendless](https://github.com/eternoendless) will share exciting news about a project organization.

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.
**If you have some, about things related to the open source project**, feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). They will be answered during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

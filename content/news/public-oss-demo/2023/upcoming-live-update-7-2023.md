The seventh Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, July 19th, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_19_Jul_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qcApq8NMhw)!

We will go over the latest project updates, take a look at recent changes in the software, changes made in the developer documentation, and more!

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

Dear community,

The first Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on [**Wednesday, January 11th, 2023 at 4pm CET**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDS51o48W1I)!
It was decided to switch from _Public Demo_ to _Live update_, as it would be great to experiment with formats other than you could see in previous sessions.

This time, as always, I expect to share with you project news, and a couple of demos are planned:
- Overview of the Hummingbird theme, by [@NeOMaking](https://github.com/NeOMaking)
- WebP and Avif in PrestaShop. New image formats generation, by [@matthieu-rolland](https://github.com/matthieu-rolland)

At the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.
**If you have some, about things related to the open source project**, feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). They will be answered during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

Dear community,

The first Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, January 11th, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_11_Jan_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDS51o48W1I)!
_Public Demo_ is now called _Live update_, as it is planned to experiment with formats other than you could see in previous sessions. Live coding sessions, interviews, etc.

This time, as always, I expect to share with you project news, and a couple of demos are planned:
- Overview of the Hummingbird theme, by [@NeOMaking](https://github.com/NeOMaking)
- WebP and Avif in PrestaShop. New image formats generation, by [@matthieu-rolland](https://github.com/matthieu-rolland)

At the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.
**If you have some, about things related to the open source project**, feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). They will be answered during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

The sixth Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, June 21st, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_21_Jun_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKBQM3fprY)!

We will go over the latest project updates, take a look at recent changes made in the developer documentation, and present two demos:

- Issue management in the PrestaShop Project by [@hibatallahAouadni](https://github.com/hibatallahAouadni)
- PrestaShop 9.0 roadmap by [@fabienvallon](https://github.com/fabienvallon)

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

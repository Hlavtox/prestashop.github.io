Friendly reminder, that the public demo for the PrestaShop Project will happen tomorrow, on [**Wednesday, December 14th, 2022 at 4pm CET**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN4k2-3onCA)!

I expect to share with you project news. Additionally, a few demos are planned:

At the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.
**If you have some, about things related to the open source project**, feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). They will be answered during the Q&A session.

Friendly reminder, that the public demo for the PrestaShop Project from the maintainers team will happen next week, on [**Wednesday, November 9th, 2022 at 4pm CET**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRf0EQX3lbg)!

We expect to share with you project news and present two topics:
- Introducing: new back office API, by [@atomiix](https://github.com/atomiix)
- PrestaShop 8.1 and beyond, by [@FabienVallon](https://github.com/FabienVallon)

At the end of every meeting, we hold a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.
**If you have some, about things related to the open source project**, feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will answer them during the Q&A session.

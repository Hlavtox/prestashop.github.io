Friendly reminder, the next session of public demonstration from the maintainers team will happen [**Wednesday, March 2, 2022 at 4pm CET**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va5zbBNjIag)!

We expect to present 3 topics:
- Horizontal migration by [@tegbessou](https://github.com/tegbessou) and [@matks](https://github.com/matks)
- New page in back office: Security by [@matks](https://github.com/matks) and [@PierreRambaud](https://github.com/PierreRambaud)
- HTTP 410 status code for products by [@kpodemski](https://github.com/kpodemski) and [@jf-viguier](https://github.com/jf-viguier)

In addition to these demos, we will also announce the result of the poll that decided the name of the new theme :tada:

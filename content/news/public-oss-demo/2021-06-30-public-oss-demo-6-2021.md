## Next session in August

We noticed that 2pm CEST was a little early in the morning for people watching us live from the Americas, so we decided that future sessions will start two hours later â€” at 4pm. We hope this will encourage our American community to watch the demo live and discuss with us :)

The next session will be streamed live on [**Wednesday, August 4, 2021 at 4pm CEST**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE6lVtdsIhE). See you then!

Our core team worked closely in the past few months with the Microsoft Azure Team to build 4 ready-to-use PrestaShop cloud hosting plans. You’re invited to discover an exclusive preview of it in Paris next week!

From standalone virtual machines to multi-VMs solutions, these 4 offers have been built to help you be more adaptable and scalable. They include powerful tools and services, such as high availability, SQL clusters and load balancers with auto-scaling web servers just to name a few.

Come to our **PrestaShop + Azure event** next week in Paris: the 7th of July, **meet the teams** in charge of the project at PrestaShop and Microsoft, and find out more information about it:

* How these hosting solutions were created
* Why we built 4 different architectures
* How to use them
* How you can benefit from it

Our guest speakers will be:

* Hervé Leclerc, CTO @ Alterway, Microsoft Azure historical partner
* Jean-François Gomez, Business Development Manager @ Microsoft Azure
* Thomas Conté, Cloud Architect @ Microsoft Azure

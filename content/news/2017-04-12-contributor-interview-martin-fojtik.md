An Open Source community is more than just PR made by faceless strangers. In order to better understand the people who contribute time and skills to the PrestaShop project, we're launching a series of interviews with contributors of all ranges. This week, meet Martin Fojtik!


**Hi Martin! How did you get involved in PrestaShop development?**

<img style="border: 1px solid #CCC; float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" width="180" height="180" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7465851"> I’ve been working as [a freelancer](http://martin-fojtik.cz/) for the past 6 years. <br/>
My first paid project was an e-shop for a friend, which I created using PrestaShop. I knew very little about CSS and HTML at that time. I still remember that feeling I had when I first saw the [product.tpl file in PrestaShop 1.4](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop-1.4/blob/master/themes/prestashop/product.tpl)! It was difficult to work with the default template at the time, but I managed to create a very good e-shop.

**What motivates you to contribute to the PrestaShop project?**

I have two main reasons why I sometimes contribute to the Open Source project.<br/>
After six years working as a programmer, I used a huge amount of free and useful materials (modules, tutorials, etc.), so I would like to create something useful for others.<br/>
The other reason is that I like programming. I think creating a pull request or fixing the bug is a great way to better understand PrestaShop and learn new things as well.

**What contribution are the most proud of so far?**

I would not say that I am somehow proud of my contributions. But for example, [the PR which improves the accessibility of frontend](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/7020) can be helpful to people with disabilities, and I like that.

_Note from PS: we're planning on improving default a11y this year, and this PR will be part of it!_

**Do you have any advice for first-time PrestaShop contributors?**

I don’t know what I would advise. I just think that even a small pull request or reporting a bug on the Forge can help other users and the community.

**Could you tell us a bit about e-commerce in your country, and how PrestaShop is used there?**

I didn’t check statistics, but from my personal experience, PrestaShop is the most used open source e-commerce system in the Czech Republic. I saw many e-shops selling a wide range of goods from healthy nutrition to electronics devices. As for details, the majority of e-shops prefer one-page checkout more than five-step ordering; and the "quick view" feature is almost never used. 

**Thanks you Martin, we hope to see you soon in our Core Weekly reports! :)**

Here is the new report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this September 2015, a rather quiet month for our project.

All the figures and statistics are (still) based on the 1.6.1.0 project.


## Updated workflow

We've recently changed the workflow on Crowdin: it's important **you should translate in the "next-version" folder in priority**.
Strings will then automatically propagate to the "1.6.1.0" folder, while the reverse won't work. So if you're working on 1.6.1.0, that's double work for everybody.
[Read more about it here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-july-2015-edition/). And don't hesitate to ask if you have some questions!

Quite a performance in Galician, wow!
Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!!

## New languages

At the request of community members, we've recently added some new languages to the project.
You can now translate PrestaShop in:

* [Montenegrin (Latin)](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/me)
* [Khmer](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/km)

So don't hesitate to join!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated string, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

These languages (still) need you as proofreaders as well:

* Turkish (94% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (78% vs 24%)
* Ukrainian (99% vs 54%)
* Galician (46% vs 11%)
* Finnish (76% vs 50%)

If you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need *your* help!



## A word from the community

Here is an update on the latest initiatives from members of the translation community.

#### Turkish
Turkish translator ftugrul is trying to gather the Turkish community. Join the [discussion on Crowdin forum](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/discussions/210) to harmonize the translation and go forward with more proofreading. We do need more proofreading in Turkish, so make yourself known if you want to participate!


## Miscellaneous

* **62 members** were active on the project this month.

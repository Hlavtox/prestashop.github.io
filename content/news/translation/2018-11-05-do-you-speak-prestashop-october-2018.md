Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in October.

## Project news


### 1.7.5 catalog ready for translation

No surprise, the 1.7.5 catalog has finally been exported and pushed in Crowdin. It is the end of a long way that leads to the soon-released PrestaShop 1.7.5 beta phase. Keep reading this devblog to be informed! And because you are the best translators’ community, most of you have already started to translate the new strings, bringing remarks to add context or correct it… thank you so much for that! How pleasant it is to be part of this wide collective work that helps everybody get each time a better translation and a much accurate wording. We are all going in the right direction, thanks to your seriousness and dedication; you can be proud. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of October 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Galician** (100% translated vs 63% validated in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Korean** (98% vs 67% in 1.6).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 72% in 1.6).

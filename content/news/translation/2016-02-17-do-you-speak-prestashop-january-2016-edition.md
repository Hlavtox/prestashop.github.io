This is the lastest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) lately, and the first report for 2016 :)

## When will we hear about 1.7 translations?

If you read the Build blog, you can see it's starting to be all about the new 1.7 version. With brand new pages (product, modules) and a new default theme, there will be new content to translate. Be prepared!

Good news. As you know, Crowdin makes it possible to propagate a translated string from a version to another. This means only the new strings specific to 1.7 will need to be translated.

Right now, we're still working on the 1.7 beta, and we're not ready to release the new version on Crowdin yet.

Of course we'll get let you know when we have more visibility on translations, so that you can take some time to have a look and help with the translation in your respective languages -- when the time comes.

In the meantime, we can still focus on the 1.6 project. Aaaaand about that... we're currently experiencing some issues with our translation system, meaning that, at the moment, we can't fetch the newest translated strings and import it to PrestaShop. We're aware of this, we're trying to find a solution, and of course we'll get back to you when it's all back to normal!

So now, let's get back to business, here are the facts and figures relating what happened in January 2016, based on the 1.6.1.0 project.

## Complete translations

At the end of January, PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in 12 languages:

* Bulgarian
* Croatian
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Lithuanian
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Slovenian
* Swedish


#### 98-99% translated languages

There isn't much work left before we reach 100% for these languages, if you feel like you want to help, [join the project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with the previous month, the following languages had the best progress in January:

* **Mongolian** (+700% - this isn't a typo, you've read correctly! - to reach 8% translated)
* **Vietnamese** (+45% to reach 100% translated - yay!!)
* **Danish** (+8,5% to reach 89% translated)

Some other languages performed well, like the Azerbaijani and Latvian teams for instance! Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

We have a newcomer in the group: Vietnamese. With so many translations this month (see above), no wonder there's a lot of proofreading ahead. And hurrah, a lot of proofreading was done for the Finnish project, so that it's no longer in the list! :)

So, last update, these languages need some proofreading at the end of January:

* Turkish (95% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (78% vs 24%)
* Vietnamese (100% vs 49%)
* Ukrainian (98% vs 53%)
* Galician (49% vs 11%)

A HUGE amount of proofreading has been done in January, so thanks to all the contributors involved! Hopefully the list will evolve next month.

If you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need *your* help!


## Miscellaneous
* **90 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 2,540 members** at the end of January. Welcome to them!
* **52 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **76,210 words have been translated** (that's a lovely +73% from previous month!) and 62,797 validated (ok so that's +227% from last month, when I said a lot has been done in proofreading, that what it meant ! :). All this in **29 different languages**.

Again, we can’t thank you enough!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment.

See you soon for the 2015 yearly report!

Here is the latest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) lately (which means this last February).

But first, everything translation at PrestaShop isn't necesserally taking place on Crowdin. Contributions can take different forms, and here's more details about a few ones:

## Side projects

### Spanish
We're recently published a few videos to guide you when translating PrestaShop into Spanish. If you're working on this language, [watch it here](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/translation/how-to-help-translating-PrestaShop-into-Spanish/) and join the [conversation on the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/486362-hilo-oficial-traducci%C3%B3n-del-software-diccionario-de-t%C3%A9rminos-gu%C3%ADa-de-estilos-y-sugerencias/)!
And thanks to Jesús who's helping with all this!

### Vietnamese installer
Vietnamese has reached a high level of completion, as already mentioned. The next step is now to **complete the several XML files** needed to have PrestaShop 100% translated. These files aren't available on Crowdin, but you can find it on this [open pull-request on Github](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/5150), or within your local installaion ('install/langs/en/data' for the English version).

Some translations are missing, like country names (country.xml), so if you want to help, you can send your translation at <a href="mailto:translation@prestashop.com">translation@prestashop.com</a>, we'd be happy to include it the current the project.

And of course this is not about Vietname only: **other languages can be updated too**. You can contribute by committing directly on GitHub, or <a href="mailto:translation@prestashop.com">sending us your translations by email</a>!

Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in February:

## A few stats
* **79 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 2,619 members** at the end of February. Welcome to them!
* **53 members** were active on the project this month.

Again, we can’t thank you enough!

That's 2 new languages in this group, thanks to the Czech and Portuguese contributors: děkuji! obrigado!

In comparison with the previous month, the following languages had the best progress in February:

* **Arabic** (+26% to reach 48% translated)

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

A pretty good month for proofreading as Vietnamese has been fully approved. We're back to 4 languages that require some proofreading at the end of February:

* Turkish (95% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (84% vs 24%)
* Ukrainian (99% vs 51%)
* Galician (49% vs 11%)


![February 2016 best translation progress](/assets/images/2016/03/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_feb16.png)

We have good hopes Slovak will evolve in the coming weeks as a few translators stepped forward to be part of the proofreading team. Finger crossed!

Like them, if you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need your help!




If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

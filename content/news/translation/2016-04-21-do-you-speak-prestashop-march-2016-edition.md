Here is the latest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) lately (which means this last March).

## Updated translations

You've been quite a few to report a problem when fetching the language packs: it doesn't include the latest translations made on Crowdin.

Yes, unfortunately, **we're (still) having issues with our synchronization system**. The language packs don't include the most recent translations from Crowdin, at the moment.
We're currently working on this, as we know it's important for a lot of merchants. Hopefully, by the end of the month the language packs will be updated to include the most recent translations on Crowdin.


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in March:

## A few stats
* **78 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 2,697 members** at the end of March. Welcome to them!
* **44 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **103,856 words have been translated** (+138%!) and **60,155 validated**.
* All this in **28 different languages**.

That's quite some work, thank you!

## Top contributors

A lot of you are working everyday on Crowdin to have PrestaShop available in many languages, and we can't thank you enough for your dedication! Here are the **most active translators and proofreaders** this March.

## Complete translations

* Bulgarian
* Croatian
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Lithuanian
* Norwegian
* Persian
* Polish
* Russian

PrestaShop was also *almost* fully translated (and/or validated) in these 6 languages:

* Czech
* Indonesian
* Portuguese
* Portuguese, Brazilian
* Romanian
* Slovak
* Spanish

We're happy to welcome Romanian in this category!
A little bit of work and these languages can be 100% translated and validated too! If you feel like you want to help, [join the project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

*(Note: since the end of March, Slovak has been fully validated, so things move fast!)*

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with February 2016, the following languages had the best progress in March:

* **German, Austria** (+50% to reach 3% translated)
* **Estonian** (+21% to reach 91% translated)
* **Slovak** (+19% to reach 100% translated - yay!)
* **Romanian** (+17% to reach 99% translated - another yay!)

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

This month also brought a good news as Slovak has been fully approved! We're down to 3 languages that require in priority some proofreading at the end of March:


* Turkish (96% translated vs 0% validated)
* Ukrainian (99% vs 53%)
* Galician (49% vs 11%)

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

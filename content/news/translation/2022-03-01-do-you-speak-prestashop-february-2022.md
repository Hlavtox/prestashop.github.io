Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in February!

## Project news

### Your pictures of the reward program

Between September and December 2021, [Mahmoud Parvazi](https://crowdin.com/profile/m.parvazi) has translated 3,306 words. This allowed him to level up, from the Traveller to the Backpacker level, and enter the reward program.

Congratulations, and thank you again for your contribution to the Persian translation project, Mahmoud!

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Isinner](https://crowdin.com/profile/isinner), who rushed into the effort immediately! 


## A few stats
 
* **18 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **37,173 words have been translated** and **42,774 validated**.
* All this in **14 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of February, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **17 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Bosnian | **Catalan** | Chinese traditional | Czech | 
| Danish | English | Estonian | Finnish | 
| French | Italian | Lithuanian | Persian | 
| Romanian | Serbian | Spanish | Spanish, Mexico |
| Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Chinese Simplified languages are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isn‚Äôt much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in February thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Catalan** (+9% to reach 100% translated and validated) 
* **Russian** (+5% to reach 99% translated)
* **German** (+2% to reach 91% validated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part to the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Read this report to see how the translations of the software evolved in July.

## Project news

### Adding Esperanto

We've received the request to add - for the second time! - Esperanto to PrestaShop.
It's been added to the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/eo#) this week, so please join us if you want our e-commerce software to be available in Esperanto :)

With the arrival of PrestaShop 1.7.2 in July, we've had a lot of activity on the translation project on Crowdin. We can't thank you enough! Here is the full report for July:

## A few stats

* **63 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **169,455 words have been translated** and **140,178 validated**.

Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of July 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (53% translated vs 19% validated in 1.7).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (65% vs 46% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (66% vs 47% in 1.7).
* **Catalan** (93% vs 76% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (49% vs 32% in 1.7).


![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/08/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_July17.png)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

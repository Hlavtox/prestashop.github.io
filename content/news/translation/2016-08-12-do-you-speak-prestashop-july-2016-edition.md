Here is the latest report to inform you of what happened on the [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) in July. It's coming a bit later than usual, but we've been busy, as you'll see!

## Project news

### Thank you <3

We witnessed a kind of "1.7 effect" on the project.
Indeed, the month of July has been quite exceptionnal with many people joining the project, and a huge peak in the activity, right after the upload of the 1.7 translations. We had a lot of active languages, with many words translated and validated.
A big thanks to all of you, whether you joined the project or you've been around for a while!!

Let's hope it stays this way :)

### String propagation

With the arrival of the 1.7 project, the propagation of translation has evolved. From now on, you should **translate in priority the 1.6 project**. The translations will then automatically propagate to the 1.7 project, when the source strings are similar, of course.

If the 1.6 project is 100% translated in your language, then you can focus on the 1.7 translation. Which makes sense since PrestaShop 1.6 is our current version, and the 1.7 version is still in its beta phase. About that, you can still [test it](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-3/) if you want to help us collect feedback!

### Translations for PrestaShop 1.7

We've updated the 1.7 project, adding more strings (mostly error messages), which is why the percentage of progression have evolved (this was last week). We also keep adding domains to the strings: some strings moved from the "message" folder to their relevant one.

We've also added some new domains, like *Admin.Dashboard* or *Admin.Login* thus adding new folders to the project. We will soon update [the article about the new translation system](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-translation-system-prestashop-17/) to let you know about all this novelties.


### Updated 1.6 translations

We've kept our update rythm (that means updating 1.6 translation every two weeks). The last update was on the 3rd of August, while the next one is planned for next week, around the 17th of August.

### Icelandic

A new language is available on our Crowdin project: Icelandic. If you speak Icelandic, join us!


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in July:

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with June 2016, the following languages had the best progress in July:

(these numbers are mostly issued from the progress of the 1.7 project, as this is where most of the work took place this month.)

* **Galician** (+109% to reach 67% translated in 1.7)
* **Lithuanian** (+23% to reach 957% translated in 1.7)
* **German** (+11% to reach 90% translated in 1.7)
* **Croatian** (+10% to reach 90% translated in 1.7)
* **Russian** (+9% to reach 100% translated in 1.7)

![July 2016 best translation progress](/assets/images/2016/08/Build_Crowdin_progress_July16.png)

Other languages performed well like Ukrainian, Spanish (Argentina), Albanian, Persian and Polish. Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentionned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of July, 7 languages would still benefit from more proofreading:

* Turkish (100% translated vs 55% validated - still improving!)
* Greek (100% translated vs 81% validated)
* Romanian (100% vs 87%)
* Ukrainian (100% vs 55%)
* Hungarian (92% vs 72%)
* Arabic (54% vs 28%)
* Galician (50% vs 14% --- althought a loooot of work has been done in 1.7!)

If you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need your help!




If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

With 1.7.1 version soon to be released, there has been some activity on the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) last month. And that comes with good news for translators too!

## Project news


### Translation for 1.7.1 are there

The next minor version of PrestaShop, [V.1.7.1, is open for testing as a beta version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-beta-1/). At the same time, [we opened it for translation on Crowdin](http://build.prestashop.com/news/171-Translations-update/).

We now have a 1.7.1 project, with fresh new strings to translate!


### Daily language packs update

Good news! You've been waiting for it, since the 1st of March, both *1.6 and 1.7 translation packs are updated every day*, automatically.

When installing or updating a language, merchants will have the latest translations from the community. And day to day, you can fetch the new translations (that have been validated). At last!


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in February:

## A few stats

* **60 contributors** joined the project last month, for a **total of 3,614 members** at the end of February 2017. Welcome to all of them!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of February 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (55% translated vs 28% validated in 1.6)
* **Galician** (67% vs 48% in 1.7)
* **Japanese** (49% translated vs 31% validated in 1.7)
* **Catalan** (94% vs 80% in 1.7)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

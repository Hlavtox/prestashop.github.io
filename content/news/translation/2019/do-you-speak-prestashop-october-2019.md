Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in October.

## Project news


### :wave: New bunch of goodies  

Here it goes again: the last goodies session of 2019 has happened, well done everybody! Our Crowdin’s best translators for those past three months have all been reached to be sent a few goodies. A few words from Coline Ginestet, Lead PM at PrestaShop, to say how important this is for us: 

*"Our mission here at PrestaShop is to provide the best e-commerce solution for any merchant around the world. By dedicating your own time and energy to add and improve the software translations, you are actively participating in reaching this ambitious goal. We want to thank you and the whole community for helping us make PrestaShop a worldwide solution accessible globally."*


### :speaker: About email translation 

I have received many questions lately regarding the email translation. Indeed, the 1.7.6 version has come with a couple of bugs on this part of the back office, due to its rework. But rest assured, they are all addressed and being fixed for PrestaShop 1.7.7. You can have a look at it [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14809) and [there](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/16294).


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated Dag Håkon Baardsen (dag.baardsen), Krzychu Raczkowski (krzychuraczkowski), marc llobera (laqmarc), Mohammed yoones afrit (myaset), orjwan.albhr, puralogica, and Piotr Mądry (Wise89). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **46 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **21,864 words have been translated** and **21,092 validated**.
* All this in **27 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of October 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (93% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (94% vs 59%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (48% vs 14%).
* **Chinese Simplified** (95% vs 64%).
* **Tagalog** (51% vs 26%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact us with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. We need your help! 
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

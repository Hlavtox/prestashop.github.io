Here is the new report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this November 2015.

## Thanks to our most active contributors!

We're reaching the end of the year and it's time to look back on what happened in 2015. If you read these reports you're probably starting to know the names of our most active contributors. It's a small team of dedicated people who spend a lot of their time translating PrestaShop. We want to say a big thank you to them!

## Complete translations

#### Fully translated languages

At the end of November, PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in 9 languages:

* Croatian
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Polish
* Slovenian
* Swedish


#### 98-99% translated languages

…and almost fully translated (and/or validated) in these 11 languages:

* Bulgarian
* Indonesian
* Lithuanian
* Norwegian
* Persian
* Portuguese, Brazilian
* Russian
* Spanish

The translators being very reactive (yes, thanks again!), these languages should be soon 100% translated (if not already by the time you read this).


## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with the previous month, the following languages had the best progress in November:

* Basque (+19% to reach 25% translated)
* Danish (+9% to reach 74% translated)
* Finnish (+3% to reach 77% translated)

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

These languages (still) need you as proofreaders:

* Turkish (92% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (77% vs 24%)
* Ukrainian (97% vs 53%)
* Galician (45% vs 11%)
* Finnish (77% vs 57%)

* **66 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **44,114 words (+67%)  have been translated** and 39,575 validated (+146%, wow!), in **36 different languages**.

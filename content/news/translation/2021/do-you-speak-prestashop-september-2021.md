Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in September!

## Project news

### üéÅ Top contributors, your gifts are on their way‚Ä¶

A while ago, I contacted the translators who had either translated enough words to enter the reward program or who had leveled up since the last mailing in May. Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution! Preston, our beloved puffin, is now on its way, wings full of goodies. So keep an eye on your mailbox and when you receive your gift, don‚Äôt forget to send a picture to translation@prestashop.com, so that we can share it here!

As a reminder, translators are ranked according to the following levels, starting from January 2020. So you must have translated at least 2500 words since January to join the program and receive goodies. If you haven't yet, don't worry, there is a mailing every three months or so.

| Level | # Words
|---------- | -------- 
| Pioneer |‚Ä´‚Ä¨ + 20,000 words
| Explorer | 8,500-20,000 words
| Adventurer | 5,000-8,500 words
| Backpacker | 2,500-5,000 words


### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [paintspec](https://crowdin.com/profile/paintspec), who rushed into the effort immediately and even ranked 7th in the top translators. Congratulations!

## A few stats
 
* **19 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **12,549 words have been translated** and **8,935 validated**.
* All this in **16 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of September, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was already fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **13 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Danish | Chinese traditional | English | Estonian |
| French | Greek | **Italian** | Lithuanian |
| Portuguese, Brazil | **Romanian** | Spanish | Spanish, Mexico |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean (99% translated and validated) is almost fully available. There isn‚Äôt much work left, so feel free to [join the project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) if you feel like contributing.

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in September thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Chinese Simplified** (+6% to reach 91% validated) 
* **Romanian** (+3% to reach 100% validated)
* **Italian** (+1% to reach 100% validated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in October!

If you have received your gift too, donâ€™t forget to send me a picture at translation@prestashop.com so that I can share it in the next Crowdin report. 

### ðŸ’• Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away, let alone become top translators! For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the efforts immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Piotr A](https://crowdin.com/profile/piotr30/activity) and [slstranslation](https://crowdin.com/profile/slstranslation/activity).

## A few stats
 
* **18 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **9,256 words have been translated** and **7,365 validated**.
* All this in **15 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Congratulations, and welcome to our new top contributors! :clap:
 
Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of October, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was already fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **14 languages**. Thatâ€™s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Danish | Chinese traditional | English | Estonian |
| French | Greek | Italian | Lithuanian |
| Portuguese, Brazil | Romanian | **Serbian** | Spanish |
| Spanish, Mexico | Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Czech are almost fully available. There is less than 5% of strings to proofread. 
There isnâ€™t much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in October thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Serbian** (+3% to reach 100% translated and validated) 
* **Chinese Simplified** (+3% to reach 94% translated and validated)
* **Persian** (+2% to reach 100% translated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part to the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Read this report to see how the translations of the software evolved in June.

## Project news


### 1.7.1 made way for 1.7.2

As we've recently released the new version 1.7.2.0, the translations folder for the version 1.7.1 has been removed.<br/>
This version brings some new content; you can [read more about it here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/172-Translations-update/).

### Domain change in 1.7.2 (read this for your themes)

As a theme creator, the 1.7.2.0 version contains modifications that could impact the theme you're selling.<br/>
If you are using the Classic strings (and attached translations) for your own theme, we've made some changes in 1.7.2 that you should report on your theme if you still want to benefit from the PrestaShop translations.

* Translation domain "Shop.Theme" is now "Shop.Theme.Global".
* Harmonization of domains for customer form: [see domains to update](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8120/files?w=1#diff-a2cd912578d421dc72b8143048ad6b16).
* Correction of "Brands list" to "Brand list": [see domains to update](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8120/files?w=1#diff-78e1e3c6e9dc564ccd16b9f633b61f7f).

And as a reminder, you can read this article to know [how theme translation works in 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/translation/how-to-translate-your-theme/) (and 1.7.2.0 brings many improvements on this side).


### Propagation process

Each time we add a new version, there can be some propagation issues. Old translations seem to come back and some more recent work can be lost. C'est la vie !

When a string is identical between versions, here is how it works:

* If translated in 1.6 folder, it will be shared with 1.7.2 folder.
* If not translated in 1.6, it won't be shared with 1.7.2 folder. But if translated in 1.7.1, the 1.7.1 translation will be propagated to 1.7.2.
* If a string is updated in 1.7.1 but NOT in 1.6 folder, it is still the 1.6 version which will be shared with new folders (1.7.2 in the present case).

Because of this propagation process, sometimes you will see old translations coming back. If you are editing existing translations, please make sure they are also corrected in version 1.6 too.

To check whether a string is available in 1.6, you need to display all strings from the project, make a search for the string, then hover on the file name to see if it comes from version 1.6 or 1.7. Then you can edit the 1.6 version too:

### 4,000+ members!

We recently welcomed the 4,000th member to the PrestaShop translation project. As of today, we're already more than 4,100 members: WOW.<br/>
Thank you for believing in open source and for helping fellow merchants in having a software translated in their language!

* **Spanish, MX** (+6% to reach 49% translated in 1.7)
* **Korean** (+2% to reach 23% translated in 1.6)
* **Romanian** (+1% to reach 100% translated in 1.6)

![Best translation progress for June 2017](/assets/images/2017/07/Build_Crowdin_progress_June17.png)

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of June 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (64% translated vs 18% validated in 1.7).
* **Galician** (65% vs 46% in 1.7).
* **Romanian** (94% vs 75% in 1.7).


![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/07/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_June17.png)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in November.

## Project news


### Bosnian

Say hello to the Bosnian translation project! It is back on our radar screens and extends once again the scope of PrestaShop, raising the number of languages available in Crowdin to 77. And it is already 18% completed! Nice score, right? So if Bosnian lovers (or just Bosnian speakers, we love everybody) want to get involved in it, and I bet you would, just subscribe [here](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/bs#) to join Rijad on stage and make this translation project grow. To infinity… and beyond!

### 1.7.3

A great thank you to all the people who have been getting into the PrestaShop projects after our call for translation. Several languages have seen their 1.7.3 branch completed fast. So fast we almost reach back into the Crowdin level at the beginning of November, where there were 20 languages completed. We appreciate it a lot. Go on, join forces, and be proud of the huge work making here. Cheers!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of November 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Portuguese, Brazil** (100% translated vs 78% validated in 1.7).
* **Korean** (36% vs 16% in 1.7).
* **Bosnian** (18% vs 0% in 1.7).
* **Arabic** (52% vs 37% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (51% vs 36% in 1.7).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please <a href="mailto:translation@prestashop.com?subject=Proofreading20PrestaShop20Translations">contact us</a> with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

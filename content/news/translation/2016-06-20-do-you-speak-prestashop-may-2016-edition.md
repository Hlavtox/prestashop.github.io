Here is the latest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) lately (= this last May).

## Project news

### Updated 1.6 translations

We've again updated the translations available in PrestaShop this week, so that you can find the latest translation available in PrestaShop. That should be of importance for the Turks, as a lot of proofreading has been going on lately.

From now on, **we plan on updating the 1.6 translations every two weeks**, so next time *should* be around the end of June. No promises however!

### Translations for PrestaShop 1.7

You've probably heard we've released the [first beta version for PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-beta-1-open-for-feedback/). We'd like to open the translation for PrestaShop 1.7 soon, so that the work can start on these shiny brand new strings!
We're working on a whole new translation system, to make things easier for translators. We'll tell you more about it soon here on Build. This is not ready yet, but it's keeping us busy :) We hope you'll like it!

### Translator's Guide

We've also published a new [Translator's Guide](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/translation/new-translator-guide-available-now/) to help you getting familiar with PrestaShop translation project. If you haven't done it yet, get it now!
We'd be happy to hear from you, if you think we should add some content or answer more of your concerns.

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with March 2016, the following languages had the best progress in May:

* **German, Luxembourg** (+500% to reach 6% translated - wow!)
* **Basque** (+5% to reach 21% translated)
* **Turkish** (+4.2% to reach 100% translated - hurrah!)
* **Chinese, Traditional** (+2.7% to reach 77% translated)
* **Spanish, Colombia** (+1.3% to reach 78% translated)

Of course this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentionned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of May, 7 languages would highly benefit from more proofreading:

* Turkish (100% translated vs 2% validated)
* Greek (100% translated vs 81% validated)
* Romanian (100% vs 84%)
* Ukrainian (100% vs 53%)
* Hungarian (92% vs 72%)
* Arabic (54% vs 28%)
* Galician (49% vs 11%)

N.B.: Since the end of May the Turkish project has been moving forward, and a lot of proofreading is going on. As I'm writing, **Turkish is already 29% validated**, which is great! Keep up the good work! :)

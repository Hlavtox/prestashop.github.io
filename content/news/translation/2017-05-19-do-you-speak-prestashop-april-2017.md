Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part to the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Read this report to see how the translations of the software evolved in April.

## Project news

### Spanish tone harmonization

A good news is that the Spanish translation is now 100% complete! However, there is sometimes a mix of polite versus familiar tone (tu/usted) that needs harmonization.
To be aligned with the global tone of PrestaShop, we're choosing to use 'tu' when talking to merchants in Spanish (= in the back office). From now on, all the translations from the back office ('Admin' domain) must use an informal tone (tu).

This doesn't impact the front office ('Shop' domains) that remains polite by default. We leave it to the merchants to change the tone of their shop, should they wish it.

As a consequence:

* We'll modify existing back office translations to harmonize the tone right away
* New back office translations must use the informal tone from now on.


### Contributor night in Paris

For those of you in Paris on the 14th of June, the night before the [PrestaShop Day Paris](http://www.prestashopday.com/fr/) will be dedicated to community contributions. Come and meet the PrestaShop team to take part in the PrestaShop project (code, documentation or translations). [More information here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-night-barcamp-prestashop-day-paris-2017/)!

## Complete translations

#### Fully translated languages

At the end of April 2017, PrestaShop 1.6.1 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **12 languages**:

| English | French | French, Canada |
| German | Greek | Italian |
| Norwegian | Russian | Slovak |
| Slovene | Swedish | Turkish |


On its side, PrestaShop 1.7.1 is fully available in **15 languages**!

| Croatian | English | French | French, Canada |
| German | Greek | Italian | Norwegian |
| Russian | Slovak | Slovene | Spanish |
| Swedish | Turkish | Ukrainian |

That's 2 extra languages: Croatian and Spanish, thank you!
And version 1.7 is well translated in 11 more languages. Soon at 100% we hope :)


## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with March 2017, the following languages had the best progress thanks to the translation community:

* **Arabic** (+14% to reach 55% translated in 1.7)
* **Japanese** (+7% to reach 78% translated in 1.7)
* **Korean** (+7% to reach 18% translated in 1.7)
* **Ukrainian** (+6% to reach 100% translated in 1.7)
* **Persian** (+5% to reach 99% translated in 1.7 - almost there!)

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of April 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (55% translated vs 18% validated in 1.7)
* **Japanese** (78% translated vs 50% validated in 1.7)
* **Galician** (66% vs 46% in 1.7)
* **Romanian** (94% vs 76% in 1.7)

![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/05/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_Avr17.png)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

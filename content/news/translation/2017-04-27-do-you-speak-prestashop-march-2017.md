More and more languages are available on PrestaShop 1.7 thanks to the help of the community on the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Read this report to see how the project evolved in March.

## Project news

### New strings to translate in project 1.6

With the update of the 1-Click-Upgrade module for 1.6 (to allow the upgrade to 1.7), we added several new strings to the 1.6 Crowdin project. We need your help to reach the completion level we had before, as some languages are no longer 100% translated.


### Call to the Argentinian community

We noticed there are some ["encoding" issues](http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-2712) in the Argentinian translations.
For example, we have strings like "like “DirecciÃ³n de Entrega” or “AÃ±adir al carrito”'

This takes a lot of time to spot and correct all the issues, so if you feel like helping, it would be great :D

How to proceed?

* Make sure you have selected "All strings" in the "File" menu
* Search for words in English that have an accent in Spanish. For example, "address", "add", "information", etc.
* Replace with the right characters when needed.

Thanks a lot!!

### Module Live Translation

In case you haven't read the latest article about the [translations for PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/translation-news-171/), we have released a [module to help you translate PrestaShop in context](http://build.prestashop.com/news/translation-news-171/#live-translation-module), that means translating directly while browsing the various pages of the software. That is much more convenient and it should help you find the right translation :)


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in March:

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of March 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Japanese** (71% translated vs 39% validated in 1.7)
* **Arabic** (41% translated vs 20% validated in 1.7)
* **Galician** (66% vs 46% in 1.7)
* **Romanian** (94% vs 76% in 1.7)

![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/04/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_Mar17.png)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

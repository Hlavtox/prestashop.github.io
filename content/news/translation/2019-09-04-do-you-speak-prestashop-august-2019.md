Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in August.

## Project news


### Emails are now available for translation

Hello all, I hope summertime was fine for each of you. A lot happened on Crowdin lately: exceptionally, the 1.7.6 catalog has been pushed again to be finally completed. Indeed, a bug prevented email translation... which was quite annoying, sorry for this quick inconvenience. We worked hard on it and corrected it for PrestaShop 1.7.6.1. And that explains why fresh translatable strings have been pushed into Crowdin. Now you can now all translate both classic and modern emails!


### Crowdin cleaning

Also, summer is a convenient time to do a bit of cleaning among our many contributions, that is why I went on all translation projects last month and removed all profiles that no longer contribute. But do not panic, this is not an arbitrary decision, it was based on the following criterion: both proofreaders and translators that have not been seen on the PrestaShop project for at least two years have been removed. Despite all our efforts to reach and motivate absent people, if you are one of those, please know you can still subscribe and start contributing again. We will be glad to have you back!


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated anpezz, Lizette Garcia
(lizette.garcia.glz), Nipsun Keittiö (lhotel53), Ramya Shantha Peiris (Ramzhead8899), Richard Rosario (shoptechmedia), and Stijn (stijn.bosman). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of August 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 16% validated in 1.6).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (54% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Galician** (94% vs 59% in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (95% vs 64% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (54% vs 24% in 1.6).

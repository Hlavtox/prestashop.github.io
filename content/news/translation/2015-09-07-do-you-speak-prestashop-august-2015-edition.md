Here is the new report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this August 2015.

All the figures and statistics are (still) based on the 1.6.1.0 project. Figures were extracted on the 27th of August, so it's not the full month, but the main trends are here.

As a reminder, we've recently changed the workflow on Crowdin, so **you should now translate in the "next-version" file in priority**. [Read all about it here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-july-2015-edition/).

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!!

We also have new active languages: thanks to translators who joined us to translate in Galician, Spanish (Colombia, Peru), Malay, and welcome to the team!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

As you might know, a translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated string, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

These languages (still) need you as proofreaders as well:

* Turkish (97% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (75% vs 25%)
* Ukrainian (92% vs 48%)
* Finnish (76% vs 50%)
* Vietnamese (42% vs 16%)

If you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need *your* help!



## A word from the community

Here is an update on the latest initiatives from members of the translation community.

#### Austrian German
We've been asked to add this new language as, for example, legal terminology in Austrian German can differ from the German. It is based on the available German translation, so that only strings whose translation is different from the German one should be translated.

## Miscellaneous
* **79 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 2,130 members** at the end of August. Welcome to them!
* **160 members** (including PrestaShop employees) were active on the project this month (+76%). This is getting big!
* A total of **55,037 words have been translated** and 34,167 validated, in **46 different languages**. It means less words translated and validated than the previous month (hey, we've all been enjoying the summer break!), but more active languages than the previous months! The community is growing, and this is great. :)

Again, we can’t thank you enough!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment.

See you next month!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in December.

## Project news


### :sparkles: Best wishes for 2020

It is that time of the year, so let us send you our best wishes for 2020! We know it is not celebrated everywhere yet but it is never too early to do so: have a happy new year, with love from family and friends, challenging and fulfilling professional opportunities and great vibes in your everyday life. You have been great in 2019, I am sure you will be even more wonderful in 2020. :-)


### :trophy: PrestaShop wins, you win

At the [Paris Open Source Summit]( https://www.opensourcesummit.paris) in December, PrestaShop has been surprised and delighted to receive… a prize for its international development! Awarded by the CNLL ([read here, in French]( https://cnll.fr/news/le-cnll-r%C3%A9v%C3%A8le-les-laur%C3%A9ats-du-concours-des-acteurs-du-libre-2019)), it rewards the international development strategy carried out since the creation of PrestaShop, possible because of its community.

So celebrating the international part of PrestaShop equals celebrating our community, and here the translators, for their commitment and the amazing work achieved every day. It is your dedication that pushes us to go further international and it is something we are very proud of. So thanks again, guys, you rock!


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated alelove, hichamaitelhaj.ma, jay_defense3, kadeka, laurilllepik, and yorbis10. See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)

* **38 members** were active on the project this month.

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of December 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (93% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (96% vs 61%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (48% vs 14%).
* **Chinese Simplified** (95% vs 68%).
* **Tagalog** (51% vs 26%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact us with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. We need your help! 
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

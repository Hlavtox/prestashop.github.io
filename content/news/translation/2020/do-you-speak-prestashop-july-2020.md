Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in April.

## Project news


### First news, a way to boost translations :fire:

As I mentioned in the [previous Crowdin Monthly](https://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-june-2020/), many PrestaShop translation projects, such as Esperanto, are reaching higher translation rates thanks to dedicated contributors. To help and encourage them, I did some tests by translating strings with Crowdin’s Pre-translation via Translation Memory (TM) tool. Simply put, this tool retrieves translations of a project and apply them to newly added strings. :sparkles:

This test was done for the Spanish, Mexico and Spanish, Colombia projects, and the translation rate went respectively from 70% to 96% and 65% to 76%. :tada: To conclude this test, proofreaders of these projects are needed to vouch for the translation consistency and approve these strings. I thus invite any Latin American native who wishes to help! :wink:

More importantly, these tests were successful thanks to translators of these projects who had contributed accurate and consistent translations. As the TM tool relies on translations of projects, the more translations are stored, the more it will be efficient. 

### A way to communicate with fellow translators?

Not long ago, the suggestion to have a communication channel for translators of the same project popped. This is a good initiative as it would allow translators to ask questions related to the project they are working on or feedback on suggested translations. Also, this could motivate and keep the community active. 
For now, considered options would be to either create a Slack channel per language or discussion groups in Crowdin (in which new onboarded translators will be added). Would that be something you are interested in? Let me know your thoughts! :blush:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated: Antonio Andina (eomaticaribadeo), Cristian Mihaila (cristi_andrei1234), Gloriana Cocozza (gcocozza), and Jose Marfil (marfil.jose). See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations! :fire:

At the end of July 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (52% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (100% vs 59%).
* **Esperanto** (40% vs 0%).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (93% vs 55%).

![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2020/07/build-crowdin-proofreading-july20.png)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

We have a newcomer in the group: Vietnamese. With so many translations this month (see above), no wonder there's a lot of proofreading ahead. And hurrah, a lot of proofreading was done for the Finnish project, so that it's no longer in the list! :)

So, these languages need you as proofreaders:

* Turkish (94% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (77% vs 24%)
* Vietnamese (69% vs 17%)
* Ukrainian (97% vs 53%)
* Galician (48% vs 11%)

Here is the latest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) in June. It's coming a bit later than usual, but we've been busy, as you'll see!

## Project news


### Translations for PrestaShop 1.7

One big news is that we recently uploaded translation for [PrestaShop 1.7](), so there's more translation to do! [Read all about it here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/translations-prestashop-17/).
The other information is that we're using a **new translation system**, so the project organization is different (and hopefully more convenient for translators). You'll find all you need to know in [this article](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-translation-system-prestashop-17/).

### Updated 1.6 translations

As planned, the 1.6 translations have been updated 2 weeks after the last update, on the 19th of June. Next update should be around the 2nd of August.

### Rulebook for Romanian translation

The Romanian community has been talking together to agree on a few rules to follow for a better translation. You can join the conversation on the [forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/254278-dorim-sau-nu-traducere-cu-diacritice/).

So far it has been decided that:

* The Romanian translation will not use diacritics
* The Romanian translation will not use honorifics

Consequently, some editing and harmonization will be going on in the Romanian project.
We hope to provide an online ressource where you can find the results of these discussions soon. Stay tuned!


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in June:

## A few stats
* **35 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 2,846 members** at the end of June. Welcome to them!

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with May 2016, the following languages had the best progress in June:

* **German, Luxembourg** (+16.7% to reach 7% translated)
* **Galician** (+2% to reach 50% translated)
* **Chinese, Traditional** (+1.3 to reach 78% translated)
* **Spanish, Colombia** (+1.3% to reach 79% translated)

![June 2016 best translation progress](/assets/images/2016/07/Build_Crowdin_progress_June16.png)

Of course this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentionned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of June, 7 languages would still benefit from more proofreading:

* Turkish (100% translated vs 40% validated - which is much better!)
* Greek (100% translated vs 81% validated)
* Romanian (100% vs 87% - in progress!)
* Ukrainian (100% vs 53%)
* Hungarian (92% vs 72%)
* Arabic (54% vs 28%)
* Galician (50% vs 11%)

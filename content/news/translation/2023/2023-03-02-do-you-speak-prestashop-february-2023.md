Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in February!

## Project news

### 🌐 The top translators page is back up

After a short interruption due to a bug, the [top translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com) is now back up and running!
This is where you'll find the top contributors of the translation project, sorted by translated words as well as the progress of every language and fully translated languages.
It’s updated every day, so feel free to check it out and see how the translation project grows!

Thank you everyone for your continued support! 💪

### 🇹🇭 New Thai proofreader

The Thai project has a new proofreader! Please welcome [Akarawuth Tamrareang (JoomlaCorner)](https://crowdin.com/profile/joomlacorner), who joined the project last month, and already translated 22,500 words!

Reminder that we are still actively looking for proofreaders in any language. Your help is needed: language projects such as Korean, Romanian, Polish or even Greek are currently almost fully translated, but not approved. 

If you’re interested in proofreading for any language, contact me on either Crowdin or Slack, I’d be more than happy to guide you. 🙌

### 💕 Many thanks to February’s newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. 
For that reason, I would like to thank [Lincoln H.l](https://crowdin.com/profile/lincolnh), [Skelroza2](https://crowdin.com/profile/skleroza2) and [t5engel](https://crowdin.com/profile/t5engel), who rushed into the efforts immediately.👏

### 🌳Translation domains and translation guide

Have you ever heard about **translation domains**?

They play a crucial part in translation and finding the right context to properly translate strings. If you wish to learn more about translation domains, you can check out the translation guide’s page on useful websites, available [here](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/resources/resources/useful-websites#translation-domains).

## A few stats

* **27 members joined the project this month.**
* **19 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **40,469 words have been translated** and **42,772 validated**.
* All this in **17 different languages**.
 
Thank you all very much for your involvement! 🙌

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of February, PrestaShop 8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **15 languages**. That’s great!

| Catalan | Chinese (CN) | Chinese (TW) | Czech |
| Dutch | **Farsi** | French | Greek |
| Hungarian | Italian | Portuguese (BR) | Spanish (ES) 
| Ukrainian | 

 Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
#### Almost there!

Korean, Italian, Greek, Romanian, and Polish are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to translate and proofread! 💪

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let’s keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop Open Source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

Thanks, everyone! 🙌

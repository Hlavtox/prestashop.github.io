Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in March.

## Project news

### üé§ Contributor interviews are back!

You‚Äôve read that right ‚Äì contributor interviews are back! 
The first interview sheds light on PrestaShop ambassador, merchant and contributor [AmirRzd](https://crowdin.com/profile/amirrzd), who‚Äôs been contributing to the translation project for nearly 8 years. 

If you wish to learn more, check out the article [here](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2023/contributor-interview-amirhossein/).

üí° Are you interested in sharing your experience with the community or sharing tips with translators in a contributor interview? 
Feel free to contact me at translation@prestashop.com or on Crowdin! ‚úâÔ∏è

### üíï Many thanks to March newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. 

For that reason, I would like to thank [moqlah](https://crowdin.com/profile/moqlah) and [Aitor Salaberria (a_mento)](https://crowdin.com/profile/a_mento/activity) who rushed into the efforts immediately. üëè

## A few stats

* **21 members joined the project this month.**
* **30 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **6,741 words have been translated** and **28,096 validated**.
* All this in **22 different languages**.
 
Thank you all very much for your involvement üôå

#### Almost there!

**Romanian**, **Lithuanian**, **Danish**, **Swedish**, and **Estonian** are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to translate and proofread! üí™

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all the contributors! üéâ
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop Open Source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

Thanks, everyone! üôå

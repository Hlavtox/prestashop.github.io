Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in December!

## Project news

### ‚ûï The PrestaShop project 2022 retrospective üéâ

2023 is here, happy new year! Thank you all for your contributions. With the help of every single one of you, PrestaShop 8.0 was released on October 26, 2022.  

Overall, in 2022,
[120 contributors](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2022/prestashop-8-0-0-available) contributed to 1100 pull requests on the GitHub side of the Project.

On the Crowdin side of the Project, 146 members translated 339,246 words and approved 319,197 words. Did you know that there are more words in the PrestaShop software than in George R. R. Martin‚Äôs Game of Thrones? 

April and August were the most active months, with a combined total of 122,405 translated words. 
Overall, 177 new contributors joined the Crowdin Project this year, adding up to a total of 3,658 members at the end of 2022.

We warmly welcome each and every one of you. ‚òïÔ∏è

### üíï Many thanks to December‚Äôs newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Monika](https://crowdin.com/profile/monikaraciunaite/activity)  who rushed into the efforts immediately!

## A few stats

* **9 members joined the project this month.**
* **21 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **3,557 words have been translated** and **1,273 validated**.
* All this in **17 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop Open Source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

Thanks everyone! üôå

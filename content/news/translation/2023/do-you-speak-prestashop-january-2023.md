Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in December!

## Project news

### ‚ûï A new language is available for translation!

Thanks to [Ali Zhumagaliev](https://crowdin.com/profile/alizhumagaliev), the Karakalpak language is now available for translation on the Crowdin project!

### üíï Many thanks to January‚Äôs newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. 
For that reason, I would like to thank [OnlyHardOfficial](https://crowdin.com/profile/onlyhardofficial), [Akarawuth Tamrareang (@JoomlaCorner)](https://crowdin.com/profile/joomlacorner) and [Ali Zhumagaliev](https://crowdin.com/profile/alizhumagaliev), who rushed into the efforts immediately.üëè

### üìñ The translation guide is there to help

Ever wondered how the translation process works? or how to become a proofreader? The translation guide is there to help. You can find it [here](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/).

## A few stats

* **27 members joined the project this month.**
* **51 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **32,248 words have been translated** and **57,383 validated**.

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop Open Source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

Thanks, everyone! üôå

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in May.

## Project news

## ðŸ§° The QA checker is up and running!
 
The Quality Assurance checker is now enabled on the translation project.

It doesnâ€™t change anything to the current translation process, but it does add a final check to make sure translation strings donâ€™t contain any typos or missing variables, among other things. The QA checker has been implemented to avoid bugs resulting from poor and unfinished translations.

If you wish to learn more, check out [the 8.1 translation catalog release article](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2023/prestashop-81-translations/), in which I explain the current QA checker settings. Note that these may change in the future, as these settings are still being fine-tuned to best fit the translation project.

Documentation regarding the QA checker has been added to [the PrestaShop Translation documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/translating-prestashop-software-basics/translating-on-crowdin/proofreaders-qa-checker-ensuring-quality-translations). If there is anything youâ€™d like me to clarify, feel free to contact me!

## ðŸ“– PrestaShop 8.1 is still ready for translation!

You can still contribute to the translation of the 8.1 catalog if you wish to do so, your help is more than welcome! 

If you have any questions or remarks, you can comment in the following discussion: https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/discussions/305, and Iâ€™ll have a look at it.

Thank you everyone for your contributions ðŸ™Œ

There is only 1% of strings to translate and proofread! ðŸ’ª

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! ðŸŽ‰
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in April.

## Project news

ðŸ“– Coming soon: PrestaShop 8.1 translation catalog!

The PrestaShop 8.1 translation catalog will be uploaded to Crowdin soon, meaning that you'll be able to translate PrestaShop 8.1 into your language. And, as usual, an article will be released to list all particularities of these new strings and add a bit of context.

To stay up to date with translation news, make sure to join the #translation channel on the {{< cta "https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/" >}}PrestaShop Open-Source project Slack{{< /cta >}}!

### ðŸ’• Many thanks to April newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. 

That's why I'd like to thank [ebela](https://crowdin.com/profile/ebela) and [ElephantOverlord](https://crowdin.com/profile/elephantoverlord) who rushed into the efforts immediately. ðŸŽ‰

#### Almost there!

**German**, **Green**, **Korean**, **Polish**, and **Romanian** are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to translate and proofread! ðŸ’ª

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! ðŸŽ‰
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

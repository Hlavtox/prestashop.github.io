Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part to the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Read this report to see how the translations of the software evolved in May.

## Project news

### Top languages evolution since January

A lot of words have been translated since the beginning of the year :)
Here's a quick overview of the evolution of the most active languages over the past few months - Thanks for your involvement!

### Deactivating Swiss-German in PrestaShop

It's been a while that the German for Switzerland is avalaible for Switzerland merchants. However, this language does not bring any value to merchants at the moment: Indeed, it is similar to the German language, and hasn't been localized to answer the needs of the Swiss market. Confusing.<br>
Thus, from 1.7.2.O onwards, the Swiss localization package will load the German language only.

The German, Switzerland translation project has also been removed from the Crowdin translation project. It has never really been maintained and it remained inactive for too long.

In the future, if merchants want to this language back, we'd be happy to re-open the language on Crowdin :)

### Deactivating inactive languages on Crowdin

In the same spirit, other inactive languages have been removed from the Crowdin project:

* Bosnian
* German, Austria
* Irish
* Kannada
* Malagasy
* Oriya
* Spanish, El Salvador
* Spanish, Honduras
* Swahili
* Swahili, Tanzania
* Telugu

Again, if you wish to contribute for one of these languages, please drop us a word at translation@prestashop.com, and this language will be available for translation again on Crowdin.

### 1.7.2 on its way

As per our release planning, we're preparing version 1.7.2.0.

Before its release, we will upload its strings to the Crowdin project:
* so that translators have the time to translate this version
* to check the content and see if any modifications are needed

There will be new content to translate soon, mostly for the [Stock Management feature](http://build.prestashop.com/news/stock-management-in-prestashop-1-7-part-2/) (which will be back in 1.7.2.0), so your help will be required.
Of course, we'll let you know on Build when the new content is uploaded!


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in May:

## A few stats

* **48 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **35,955 words have been translated** and **29,480 validated**.
* All this in **39 different languages**.

Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of May 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Galician** (66% vs 46% in 1.7)
* **Arabic** (64% translated vs 18% validated in 1.7)
* **Japanese** (82% translated vs 63% validated in 1.7 - getting better!)
* **Romanian** (95% vs 76% in 1.7)


![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/06/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_May17.png)

Again, these figures are mostly for 1.7, but 1.6 needs some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you'd like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

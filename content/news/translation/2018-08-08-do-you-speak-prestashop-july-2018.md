Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in July.

## Project news


### Arabic

Arabic is now fully translated for the 1.7 catalogs, congratulations to all the people who helped to complete it! It is a big step forward for all PrestaShop merchants that will now get the possibility to sell abroad and address Arabic customers. Want to help us complete the 1.6 catalog? Have a look at it [here](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/ar#)!


### Cast a glow on our great translation community

You know we are reworking on the [translation page](https://www.prestashop.com/en/translations), well we are also figuring out how to automate the import of data for the [translators page](http://translators.prestashop.com). I hope we can come with a solution by the end of the year, it would be a great reward for all the community. Speaking of that, goodies have been sent to the best translators in July, check your letterboxes if it is your case… thank you again!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of July 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Korean** (92% translated vs 33% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 52% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (54% vs 15% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (95% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Filipino** (56% vs 32% in 1.7).

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

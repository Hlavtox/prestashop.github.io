Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in August.

## Project news


### New languages in PrestaShop

Because a great work has been done lately on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official), we felt that it was important to review all the languages already supported by PrestaShop and consider adding the ones with a high level of translation and/or a quick evolution so that the software can match the current state of translation. New ones such as Bosnian, Hindi, Gujarati, Tagalog, and Uzbek.

In order to take the involvement of their translators and validators into account, and because they both make the projects reach nice rates of completion, we are currently adding them to PrestaShop. And it is the same story for languages with a fully translated and validated 'Install' file. So the installer should be available in at least forty languages from version 1.7.5. And it is news we are pretty happy to share with you all! 


### About Filipino

Following this idea to include more supported languages in PrestaShop, we decided to make Filipino translators proud of their work by adding Tagalog to the software. Why not Filipino? Because the software cannot stand ISO codes with more than two letters and since Filipino is the recent language based on the Tagalog dialect, we took the decision to work on the Tagalog translation project only.

It is the reason why the Filipino translation project will be soon closed on Crowdin. So we invite Filipino people to subscribe to the Tagalog project instead if they feel like it, it is [here]( https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/tl#) and it will help us a lot since it has reached 77% of translation. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of August 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Korean** (97% translated vs 45% validated in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (82% vs 32% in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 52% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (54% vs 15% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Argentina** (44% vs 13% in 1.7).

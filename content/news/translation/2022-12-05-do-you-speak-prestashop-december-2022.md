Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in November!

## Project news

### ‚ûï Our translation guide is now available üéâ

Christmas draws near. We teased our little gift last month and it is finally here (*drumrolls*): the translation guide to PrestaShop software is now available. The guide has everything you need to get started or dig deeper into the Crowdin project. 

In this guide, you‚Äôll find explanations on:

* How to contribute to translations
* Crowdin‚Äôs basics
* Proofreading
* Some useful resources

For now, the translation guide is available in two languages, English and French.

* [English](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/)
* [French](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/v/french-2/)

If you wish to see new content added to this guide, let us know on Slack or on Crowdin and we‚Äôd be more than happy to help.
Note that (as always) you can [contribute to translating the documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/translating-prestashop-software-basics/translating-documentation) if you wish to add or edit some elements. 

### Proofreaders still needed!

Your project needs you! Are you able to proofread for the Spanish (Argentina), Galician or Flemish projects? If so your help is needed: the projects are currently almost fully translated, but not approved. Reach me on either Crowdin or Slack, I‚Äôd be more than happy to guide you. üôå

Interested in proofreading for any other language? Let me know! Your help is precious, and proofreaders are always welcome. üëè

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Stellageo](https://crowdin.com/profile/stellageo/activity) who rushed into the efforts immediately!

## A few stats

* **16 members joined the project this month.**
* **17 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **4,674 words have been translated** and **7,757 validated**.
* All this in **17 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop Open Source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

Merry (early) Christmas! üéÑ

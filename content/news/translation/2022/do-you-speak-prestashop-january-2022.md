Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in January!

## Project news

### Top contributors, watch your mailbox! :mailbox:

On January 18, the packages were sent to our top translators, as part of the translator reward program. So if you are concerned, watch your mailbox and remember to send a picture to translation@prestashop.com. ðŸ“¸

### ðŸ’• Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Jeff Lee](https://crowdin.com/profile/dglzhh), who rushed into the effort immediately! 


## A few stats
 
* **52 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **31,481 words have been translated** and **57,435 validated**.
* All this in **32 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of January, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **16 languages**. Thatâ€™s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| **Bosnian** | **Czech** | Chinese traditional | Danish | 
| English | Estonian | **Finnish** | French | 
| Italian | Lithuanian | **Persian** | Romanian 
| Serbian | Spanish | Spanish, Mexico | Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean, Portuguese BR, and Chinese Simplified are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isnâ€™t much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in January thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Bosnian** (+50% to reach 100% translated and validated) 
* **Catalan** (+8% to reach 90% validated)
* **Finnish** (+6% to reach 74% translated and validated)

Congratulations! And special thanks to [Rijad Osmanovic](https://crowdin.com/profile/rijado), who worked a lot on the Bosnian project lately. Progress of 50%, alone, and in just one month, thatâ€™s incredible! The language is now completely translated and validated. :muscle:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Letâ€™s keep in touch!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

You can also join the #translation channel of the PrestaShop open source Slack. On this channel, I share information about the translation project.

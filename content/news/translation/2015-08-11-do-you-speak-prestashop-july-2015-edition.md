Here is the new report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this July 2015.

All the figures and statistics are now based on the **1.6.1.0 project**, released early June, which is the last stable version of PrestaShop. Even thought previous reports were still about the 1.6.0.14 version, the figures for this month are a comparison with the state of 1.6.1.0 in June (as the project was already available in Crowdin).

## New Crowdin workflow

Before anything, you must be aware we've changing the workflow on Crowdin, to reflect our new semantic versioning scheme, and branch organization.

We previously had two files on Crowdin, with the last stable version released (1.6.0.14), and the next one to come (1.6.1.0). Translations were propagated from the oldest version to the newest (1.6.0.14 > 1.6.1.0).

From now on, we still have two files, but the way it works is a bit different:

* The 'main' file will be called '**next-version**'.<br/>
It includes the latest strings on which we've been working. **This is where strings must be translated**.

* The '**release**' file, called after the latest release.<br/>
When we're getting close to releasing a new version, we will create a new file (e.g. 1.6.1.1), which will inherit translations from the 'next-version' file. The purpose of this 'release' file is mainly to allow fixes on strings once a version is released.
Any translation done or edited in this file should be reported in the 'next-version' file, otherwise it would be lost for future versions (as it stays in this file and is not shared with the 'next-version' file).

Today we have the '1.6.1.0' file, as it's the latest release. Remember, anything translated there will not be propagated to the main project, which is 'next-version'.<br/>
Should you have any question regarding this, please don't hesitate to comment or contact me.

Now, let's get back to the congratulations for your contributions in July:

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!!

We've imported some translations from external contributions. Georgian has now translations for the front-office kindly sent by Levan Beruchashvili. Thank you!

We also have new active languages: thanks to translators who joined us to translate to Estonian, Azerbaïjani, Macedonian, Arabic. Welcome to the team!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

As you probably know, a translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

There's been a lot of proofreading going on in July (+49% compare to June), it's great! Unfortunately some languages are still a bit behind:

* Turkish (93% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (77% vs 24%)
* Ukrainian (98% vs 45%)
* Finnish (75% vs 50%)
* Vietnamese (41% vs 16%)
* Hungarian (91% vs 76%)

![July 2015 best translation progress](/assets/images/2015/08/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_july15.png)

Turkish, Ukrainian and Hungarian have a high level of completion. We need your help so that these languages can be available to PrestaShop merchants! As long as it is not proofread, it won't be available in PrestaShop. Let's do something about it!

If you wish to contribute by proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread.


## Ambassador Program

As you might have heard, we're launching an [Ambassadors program](http://ambassadors.prestashop.com/). Ambassadors have joined from several countries already and some of them are Crowdin members. So don't hesitate to get in touch with them: harmonization, glossary, meeting other translators... whatever you want to do for your language / country, Ambassadors can help you to reach the community!

Here are the PrestaShop Ambassadors you can find on Crowdin:

* Spanish, Argentina: **shacker** (Lucas Vitale) and **ariels3** (Ariel Spampinato)
* Spanish, Colombia: **jorgevrgs** (Jorge Vargas)
* Spanish, Peru: **carlosloyola14** (Carlos Loyola)
* French, Belgium: **PrestaEdit** (Jonathan Danse)

You can see other ambassadors for your country [there](http://ambassadors.prestashop.com/ambassadors?page=2).

Here is the latest report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) lately (which means this last April).

## Some news first

### Updated translations: it happened!

Good news! Last week we updated the 1.6 language packs, so they now include the newest translations from Crowdin.
This means that when you update the languages in your shop, you can now benefit from some recent translations from Crowdin. That's big news for Estonian, Greek, Slovak, and Vietnamese for instance, as they made some huge progress recently.

The not-so-good news is that the automatic update process is still not working... For now we'll update the language packs manually, so the updates won't be regular for a while.
We're fully aware that this NOT ideal, but our resources are dedicated to the development of a whole new system, working for both PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 versions. It should be implemented once the 1.7 strings are imported to Crowdin, so expect more news about this in the coming months.

### What about that 1.6.1.4 folder I saw?

You might have noticed a 1.6.1.4 folder for some time... it was added when we updated the translation packs. It turned out the folder wasn't complete (admin file was missing for instance, which is a big part of the project) and in the end it did not bring much to the project: all the 1.6.1.4 and 1.6.1.5 strings are already in the "next-version" folder.
For this reason, the 1.6.1.4 folder is no longer. You can keep on working as usual in the "next-version" folder!

### Translator guide

We're currently working on a translator guide so that we can:

* better welcome new translators to the project
* answer any question you may have when translating PrestaShop

It will soon be available as a downloadable PDF and a dedicated page on Build.
In the meantime, if you want to help us in giving you the right information, we need your feedback:

#### 98-99% translated languages

PrestaShop was also *almost* fully translated (and/or validated) in these 6 languages:

* Czech
* German
* Portuguese
* Portuguese, Brazilian
* Romanian
* Vietnamese

A little bit of work and these languages can be 100% translated and validated too! If you feel like you want to help, [join the project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with March 2016, the following languages had the best progress in April:

* **Chinese traditional** (+1.5% to reach 75% translated)
* **Spanish, Colombia** (+1.3% to reach 77% translated - yay!)
* **Estonian** (+1.1% to reach 92% translated)

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of April, 3 languages required in priority some proofreading:


* Turkish (96% translated vs 1% validated)
* Ukrainian (100% vs 53%)
* Galician (49% vs 11%)

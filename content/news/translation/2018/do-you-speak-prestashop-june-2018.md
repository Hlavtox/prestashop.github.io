Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in June.

## Project news


### Uzbek

Please welcome the Uzbek translation project! It is our latest addition to Crowdin, open for the first time, so everything is to be done. Want to get involved in it? Just subscribe [here]( https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/uz#) and treat yourselves to make this translation project grow bigger and bigger. ;-)


### Our translation page is under construction

We all know it, the [translation page]( https://www.prestashop.com/en/translations) needs to be reworked. We are testing a new design on its French version to keep things clearer and better for the merchants to understand. Let’s hope it will soon be online. At least with the right content! We also realized we could improve this page with more valuable information, so you can expect a beautiful brand new page in the next few months!


### Utopian is back in the game

We introduced Utopian in the [February report]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-february-2018) and let you know the following month that the rewarding platform just suspended the monetizing of translation contribution in order to think about how to better manage this system. Well, good news everybody: it’s back in the game! It is DaVinci Witness that will keep an eye on it with an organization that will slightly differ from the first steps of the program. Want to be part of it? Just read about it [here](https://steemit.com/witness-update/@davinci.witness/davinci-witness-update-6-utopian-io-translation-rewards-are-coming-back)!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of June 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% translated vs 52% validated in 1.7).
* **Korean** (76% vs 32% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 15% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (94% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Filipino** (53% vs 24% in 1.6).

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

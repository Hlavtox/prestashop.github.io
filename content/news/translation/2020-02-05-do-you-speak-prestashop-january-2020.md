Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in January.

Save the date(s) and plan your visit! Our famous PrestaShop Days are coming back in 2020 and the first announced are Paris and Madrid. Book either your June 4th at the Palais Brongniart in Paris right [here](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-day-paris-2020/fr?utm_source=crowding&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=psdparis) or your April 16th at La Nave in Madrid [there](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-day-madrid-2020/es/?utm_source=crowding&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=psdmadrid) to meet the PrestaShop teams and the whole ecosystem around.


### :rainbow: Kurdish available for translation

Another translation project has joined our Crowdin page: please welcome our brand new [Kurdish project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/ku#)! If you’re a Kurdish merchant, translator or agency, feel free to join [Salar Nazar](https://crowdin.com/profile/salarnazar) on stage to make the Kurdish progress, and PrestaShop go further international!


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated dmitxe and Salar Nazar (salarnazar). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **22 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **19,957 words have been translated** and **12,690 validated**.

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of January 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (93% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (96% vs 61%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (48% vs 14%).
* **Chinese Simplified** (95% vs 68%).
* **Tagalog** (51% vs 26%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact us with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. We need your help! 
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in January.

## Project news


### New projects

2019 arrived with two translation projects coming out of the ground, how nice it is to start the year with two extra languages to work on: let’s give Flemish and Valencian a warm welcome! We can now count 76 translation projects available on Crowdin, and it is quite a nice score regarding the involvement it implies. We are proud of our community. Be part of it, join Peter Visser and start building a more and more international solution all together!


### Script and data difficulties

Last month has been a bit of a problem regarding some script parameters. So basically, this report will only focus on the first half of January, since our data stopped to be retrievable on the 14th… before going back these past few days. It is fixed now, but we could not succeed in restoring the missing data part. Sorry about that. As for the translations, don’t worry, you will not lack any wording, everything is up-to-date. And that is the most important.


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lots of love to the dedicated CMLEUNG, Svemirac, malik.krak, Rolige, Laimonas Mituzas, and amar505. See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **24 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **261,175 words have been translated** and **13,972 validated**.
* All this in **19 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
On the 14th of January 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Galician** (100% translated vs 62% validated in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 71% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Arabic** (98% vs 73% in 1.6).

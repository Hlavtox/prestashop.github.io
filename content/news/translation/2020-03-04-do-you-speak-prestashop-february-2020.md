Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in February.

## Project news


### :calendar: PrestaShop Day Madrid is postponed

In the current context related to the coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak and its spread in Europe, we have decided to postpone the PrestaShop Day Madrid to a later date. This decision is a preventive measure aimed at preserving the health of all participants and all those involved in the organization of the event. We will keep you posted as soon as a new date is set for the event, thank you for your patience and understanding. 


### :wave: 1.7.7 catalog is ready for translation

Hey guys, guess what: a new translation catalog is now available! And not any kind of catalog, the 1.7.7 catalog indeed! Imported from the PrestaShop code last week, it works the same as usual: please add as many comments to spot grammar mistakes, require elements of context or ask questions as you need. It will be corrected on our end so that the wordings can be modified within the code, then gathered and pushed on Crowdin one more time, generating a catalog perfectly adjusted by you all.


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated Abd-Elmaksoud Fawzy (abdelmksoud), Anatol Pogoriliy (dekameron), Baumbach, caos30, carlosneves, Muhammad Younas (kokopukhtoon), Stéphane Robert (8ternity), and Veli baygın (kalinox). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of February 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (96% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (93% vs 59%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (46% vs 14%).
* **Arabic** (95% vs 71%).
* **Tagalog** (48% vs 25%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact us with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. We need your help! 
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

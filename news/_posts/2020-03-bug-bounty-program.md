Protecting the business, data and privacy of PrestaShop's users is one of our top priority. We build the software with this goal in mind.
That's why we decided to welcome help from the outside through a bounty program to put our security to the test!

# Why this program

Bug bounties are used by many leading companies to improve the security of their products.
These programs provide an incentive for researchers to responsibly disclose software bugs and allow security teams to
leverage the external community to help keep users safe.

Cyber criminals from around the world are continuously finding new ways of breaking websites or stealing
personal information and more if they are related to ecommerce.

By creating this program, and even if it may appear as digging our own grave, it is more about prevention.
It invites White Hat Hacker to play with us and report issues before a "bad guy" messes up.

# What's in scope

First of all, keep in mind this bounty programm does not concern regular bugs, but only security flaws.
If you have problems and wish to report a bug, feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository [PrestaShop/PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose)

Then, this bounty program covers code from our GitHub repository [PrestaShop/PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop).

We are particularity interested in Remote Code Execution, SQL Injections, Authentication bypass, and obviously XSS with demonstrable business impact.

Also, we consider non-qualitfying vulnerabilities for any [CVSS3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) score lower than 4.0, unless it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve a higher score.

Find more information about qualifying and non-qualifying vulnerabilities and of course everything about Vulnerability disclosure on our [YesWeHack Public Program](https://yeswehack.com/programs/prestashop)!

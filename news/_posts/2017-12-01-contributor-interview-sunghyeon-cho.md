An Open Source community is more than just PR made by faceless strangers. In order to better understand the people who contribute time and skills to the PrestaShop project, we're launching a series of interviews with contributors of all ranges. This week, meet [SungHyeon Cho](https://crowdin.com/profile/jaymz9634)!

**Hi SungHyeon! First, could you tell us a bit about yourself?**

Hello! I'm a 41 years-old web developer and systems engineer, Java developer and DBA. I'm currently working at the publishing company's computer department. I love music very much, I'm playing the guitar in a heavy metal band.

My main interest is open source localization. Korean engineers are surprisingly weak in English, they are afraid to see English documents and APIs. It explains why I want to help Korean engineers to access easily technical documents.


**When and why did you get involved in contributing to the PrestaShop project? What motivates you?**

When I first got into PrestaShop, I was running the online shop of my company, the website was too old and I was looking for alternatives because it was so errory. As the company naturally tried to save money, I was looking for an open source ecommerce solution… and what I found by searching is PrestaShop. My boss was weak in English, he wanted to see even simple menus in Korean.

So I checked to see if a Korean version was available and I confirmed that I could officially participate in the translation. I thought that I could translate it myself so that everyone could use it. In fact, when I start translating, another Korean person suggested that I do business with it but I ignored it, I think open source should be used like open source.


**Do you have any advice for first-time PrestaShop contributors?**

As a result, a lot of people get involved in Crowdin, doing first a lot of translation work but becoming soon quiet. I also did translate a lot at first. But after a while I felt I had to practice translation like a daily routine rather than doing it all at once. When I started the Korean translation project, the progress was only 23%. Now it's 41%. When I see that number, I'm so proud of it.


**What’s the number one thing you’ve learnt by contributing to Open Source projects?**

"Oh, I have a world I did not know about, I still have to study it!" - and it seems to be able to get away from the technology used only in Korea. Should I say that technology has gotten a little wider? Really, it's very enjoyable because it seems to be the most useful experience in my life.


**Thank you SungHyeon, we hope to see you more from you as PrestaShop evolves! :)**

Remember I told you about weird blue elephpants two weeks ago? You got it, it was our dream team of developers that attended the AFUP’s annual conference in Paris! As agreed, they came back with a lot to share on Build. Here, @tomlev will told you about Jean-François Lépine and the lecture he gave at the PHP Forum:


## Faut-il faire du travail de qualité ?

“It was particularly stimulating because he put into words some intuitions you have when you've been doing web development for years.

Indeed, when starting web development, a lot of developers first focus on technique, they want to code “clean”, etc. and they act towards the same conclusion: each time a new developer arrives, he disapproves what has been done before and always wants to change it all. But take a small step back, then you realize removing working parts of the source code is not that relevant. Even if they are not “state of the art”. It is the idea of Jean-François Lépine when he declares (among other interesting statements) in this lecture that letting a bug unfixed can sometimes stands for quality approach.

And this is exactly what I've learned from my experience, personally and professionally! Some things exist and just because they are not meeting any actual standard (regarding quality, performance or even excellence) does not mean these things have not did at the time they were created. It refers to the famous phrase: at least it exists! In other words: yes, we could spend more time to make it better, nicer or with higher performance, but for now, at least it works.

Besides, another topic driven by Jean-François Lépine particularly draws my attention when he said it was necessary to focus on a small number of quality objectives (2 out of 20, to be specific) as attempting to achieve the others is totally pointless. When teams are well-coordinated on those 2 points, it allows a very much reliable assessment of the bug priority. Considering the multiple round trips between product, development and management teams for some requests, prioritize upstream/before is a great time-saving!”


### A few words on Jean-François Lépine

[Jean-François Lépine](http://lepine.pro), @Halleck45, is greatly involved in software quality. He is a web consultant who wrote a couple of books on open-source, and he is regularly invited to give lectures at the AFUP’s annual conference. He also created [PhpMetrics](http://www.phpmetrics.org), a tool for PHP static analysis.


Note that the AFUP put videos of all lectures given at the last PHP Forum online, on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/afupPHP/featured). How kind!

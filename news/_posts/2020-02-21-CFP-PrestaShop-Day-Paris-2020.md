Last year, a developer space was available at the PrestaShop Day Paris. This year, this space grows and will include an area for conferences and workshops dedicated to active contributors to the open source project.

The event will take place in Paris, at "Palais Brongniart", June the 4th of 2020. More informations:  
https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-day-paris-2020/fr/

## Th√®mes

Below is a list of themes for the call of papers that would be very appreciated this year.

**Technique:**

- FO or BO integration
- Headless, PWA, API /. web-services
- Information systems
- Migration to PrestaShop
- Performance, tests and quality

**Project and community:**

- Contribute to PrestaShop
- Use of GitHub
- Open source culture

Do not hesitate to propose a topic around the PrestaShop project. All submissions will be studied.

The target is to share and exchange knowledge, best practices and know how.

## Formats

Three conference formats are proposed in 2020:

- 45min workshop
- 30min talk
- 5min lightning talk

In order to respect the program, the speakers and the attendees at the show, no additional time will be allocated. Therefore, talks must be very well prepared.

## Language

For this edition of PrestaShop Day Paris, two elements are considered:

- Attendance is usually mostly French
- This will be our very first CFP

Consequently, all workshops, talks and slides must be in French -- "et sans faute d'orthographe".

## Agenda and program selection

13/03: End of the first round  
16/03: Announcement of the first speakers  
10/04: Closing of the CFP and the form  
20/04: Announce of the complete program

A first selection of submissions will be done on March 13th of 2020. And a first communication should done around March the 16th of 2020 to announce the first speakers. If you want to be selectionned, don't be late.

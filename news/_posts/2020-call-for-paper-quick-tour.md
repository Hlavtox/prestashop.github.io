This year, for the first time, a Call for Paper has been organised for a PrestaShop event. The target was to give a voice to the community and learn from its active members. Let's make a quick tour of the results.


## Because it's 2020

Launched during Spring with a Google Form, the Call for Paper was originally targeted for PrestaShop Day Paris 2020, in June. Unfortunately, due to the health crisis, this event has been canceled, like all other events. However, many people contributed talk proposals, so, there was many questions left. The most obvious one was to know if a french event, "IRL" or virtual, would be organised on second semester.

Once it has been dediced to make a virtual event in October, it was possible to think about using the talk proposals. And, with the PrestaShop company's Events team, the work started to find a way to include talks from the CFP in the schedule.

The result is great: 4 speakers from the community have participed and their talk have been recorded.


## The talks

For this firt edition, all talks were in French only, as they were targeted for PSDay Paris. Below is the list of the talks, and the recordings, available on Youtube.

In parallel, the tech team at PrestaShop organised "Stream your tech", targeted to the developer community. It is a live streaming to share what they do and answer to questions. It has been recorded in two parts, listed below. And, as there has been great feedback about it, this kind of format will certainly be organised again (stay tuned).

## Conclusion

The Call For Paper was quite new to organise, and difficult to maintain it in 2020, but overall, it was great to make it happen. And I really hope it will be possible to organise a new one next year. Please, share in the comments what you liked most this year, what could be improved, and what you would like to see in 2022.

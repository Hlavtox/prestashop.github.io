This edition of the Core Monthly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase from November

![Core Monthly banner](/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg)

## General messages

Dear developers,

Here it is! The first edition of the Core Monthly. I know through community feedback about the impact weekly summaries recently had, this is why it was decided to summarize the entire month in one article to make them more useful. This way, more time can be invested in providing you with relevant news about the project.

In this Core Monthly, I will focus on a few important topics that are being worked on inside the project, the new product page, initiatives, new releases, and a few others.

### What happened in November?

#### Office hours

Let's start with something very exciting: [regular meetings with the community have started](/news/office-hours/). They are different from our monthly Public Demos. The Office Hours initiative is about project members making themselves available to you, to the community, (almost) every Tuesday at 11 AM CET, to discuss everything related to the project.

These meetings have already proven it was a great idea. There have been constructive discussions about many ongoing projects, Pull Requests, architectural decisions, etc. This is also a chance to answer some community questions and help them finish their contributions.

Looking forward to meeting you at our next meetings.

#### Public Demo

The eighth demo of the year was held - this time with two presentations from project members. If you haven't watched it already, make sure to [read the summary](/news/public-demo-8-2022/).

#### Committers

In November, [three new committers were welcomed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/pull/141). An interesting development is a decision that was taken for committers [to act as code owners](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30377). What does it mean? Until then, the rules were as follows: a Pull Request to the Core had to be approved by at least one maintainer. Now, two committers can fully approve it. This seemingly small step is significant for the entire project.

If you are an active member of the project and want to join as a committer, you can read how to do this [on the article](https://www.prestashop-project.org/maintainers-guide/how-to-become-a-committer/) on the project's website.

#### Focus on code changes

With PrestaShop 8.0 released a month ago, a feature freeze is already getting closer for PrestaShop 8.1. There are a few major subjects for this version that project members are working on.

**Product page**

The first subject is a new product page. The team responsible for this project is working hard to make all the needed changes in the code.

Ongoing work on [the unification of some commands](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30381) and some refactoring, crucial for the page to be more efficient: so developers can use reliably created commands. In almost every Pull Request related to the new product page, you may notice several new or modified [automated tests](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30248/files#diff-8f4440222a254dfc66f71464d4d693250a4e2367a1d7a808df6fd308948af694). This should help the team deliver a product page more stable than ever.

You can also find some Pull Requests about improving or [adding multi store compatibility to the new product page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/28395).

**New features coming to PrestaShop 8.1**

In November, the community created a few outstanding Pull Requests (which are now merged) with features that are going to be available in the next minor version. Starting with **three (!)** changes from @Hlavtox. He added a new setting to decide if [the order should switch to backorder state](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29753). The second is the highly requested possibility of adding availability labels to each combination. In PrestaShop 8.1, this will be possible [thanks to Daniel and his changes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29411). Last but not least, [more options for discontinued products](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29720) should help merchants better manage such articles in PrestaShop.

If you've already seen the Public Demo in November, you know there's ongoing work related to the API in PrestaShop. You can check [one of the Pull Requests](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29931) that is authored by @atomiix to see more details, and [read an EPIC](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/29766) created to summarize all the planned work around an API.

There will also be a [new option to disable the [Shop Name] prefix from outgoing emails](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30277), thanks to the change from @rmilecki.

**PrestaShop 1.7.8.8**

The next patch version for PrestaShop 1.7 is at the very last step of the release process, and you can expect to see it live in a few days.

It is important for you to know that PrestaShop 1.7 has entered Extended Support mode since the [release of PrestaShop 8.0](/news/prestashop-1-7-8-7-maintenance-release/). The extended support for PrestaShop 1.7 will continue until PrestaShop 9.0 is released, estimated by the end of 2023.

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in August!

## Project news

### PrestaShop 1.7.8 will be released soon...Translators: ready, set, go!

PrestaShop 1.7.8 will be released in the coming weeks. As you know, a new version also means new strings to translate! And because you are such a great and dedicated community, this version is already fully translated and validated in 11 languages, even before its official release. This is great! For projects that have not yet returned to a 100% completion rate, there’s still time to translate! Translators, proofreaders… your project needs you! Feel free to check out new translations and help your language reach 100% so that everything is ready for the 1.7.8 release!

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Tughrul Alp](https://crowdin.com/profile/Tughrul_Alp), [Mahmoud Parvazi](https://crowdin.com/profile/m.parvazi), [Hant](https://crowdin.com/profile/haunt), and [garethvjones1976](https://crowdin.com/profile/garethvjones1976).

Special congratulations to Mahmoud and Hant who already appear in the top translator list, after only 1 month!

## A few stats
 
* **22 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **7,769 words have been translated** and **5,150 validated**.
* All this in **18 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Italian (100% translated and 99% validated) and Korean (99% translated and validated) are almost fully available. There isn’t much work left, so, feel free to [join the project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) if you feel like contributing!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in June!

## Project news

### New 1.7.8 strings are available for translation

The new 1.7.8 strings were added to Crowdin for the first time at the end of May. Since then, some of you reported a few mistakes in the source strings, that we were able to correct and add on Crowdin, on June 24. Thank you very much for your help! That was the last push, so no new strings should be added to the 1.7.8 catalog from now on. In order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the new strings should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

### Let’s keep in touch on Slack

Until now, to exchange with the community, we used the “Discussions” tab on Crowdin. But this option seemed a bit limited as it is not possible to share images, and there is little interaction. That’s why we decided to open a **Slack channel dedicated to the PrestaShop translators**. 
On this channel, I will share information about the translation project. You will also be informed about the publication of the Crowdin monthly report. Of course, you will also be able to ask questions, suggest ideas, or get in touch with other translators.

[Join us](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg) on the PrestaShop Open Source Slack! When you’re in, you will be able to join the #translation channel.

### Share your thoughts on a wording issue
It was suggested in the issue [#24954](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/24954) to replace "product combination" with "product variation" in the back office. As this wording has been used for some time in the back office, we wouldn't want to create confusion. So, in order to get merchants' thoughts on this topic, we created a [quick survey](https://forms-prestashop.typeform.com/to/lgX5aZea).
So, if you are reading this and you are a merchant using PrestaShop, feel free to complete this survey and share it with merchants in your network. :pray:
Thank you very much in advance for your feedback!
### Your pictures of the reward program

[SeongHyeon Cho](https://crowdin.com/profile/jaymz9634) received his package a month ago and sent us a picture of the gift with a nice message! Thank you again for your involvement in the Korean project!

If you received your gift as well, feel free to send us a picture so that we can share it here! It’s always nice to know that you received our package. :innocent:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [whenwesober](https://crowdin.com/profile/whenwesober), [hakan esen](https://crowdin.com/profile/esenhakan), [Antonio Festa](https://crowdin.com/profile/alessandrafesta), [EchoBilisim](https://crowdin.com/profile/echobilisim), and [jugman](https://crowdin.com/profile/jugman)! 

## A few stats
 
* **53 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **93,763 words have been translated** and **88,542 validated**.
* All this in **32 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of June, just a few days after the new strings were added to Crowdin, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was already fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **7 languages**. That’s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Chinese traditional | English | Estonian | French | 
| Greek | Portuguese, Brazil | Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! 

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Serbian (Latin)** (+36% to reach 97% translated and validated) 
* **Czech** (+5% to reach 99% translated)
* **Greek** (+5% to reach 100% translated and validated)

Congratulations! And a special thanks to [Zoran Tejic](https://crowdin.com/profile/zotamal) who worked a lot on the Serbian project lately. Only 3% left before the language is fully available, almost there! Feel free to [contact me](https://crowdin.com/profile/julievrz) if you want to help the Serbian translators reach 100%.

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since it is working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I will include a word about it in the next monthly report.

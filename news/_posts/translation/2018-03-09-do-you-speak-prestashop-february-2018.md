Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in February.

## Project news


### Utopian and the proofreading rights

Utopian is a rewarding platform that allows contributors to open source projects to monetize their involvement. In short, to benefit from the rated quality of their dedication. And rules require now for the Crowdin translators to be proofreaders in order to have their contribution rewarded.

Regarding PrestaShop, we are quite strict on that status. A lot of messages were sent to us to get this right but I'm afraid we cannot turn one candidate into a proofreader if he has not proved himself before as a great translator. Why? Because we are a professional company that hosts 270,000 stores around the world and, for that, we need an extremely serious and accurate translation.

It is not about the amount of work, but its quality. A candidate is expected to write and translate correctly, pay attention to special characters, respect the project history, the ecommerce and marketing context, the harmonization, etc. If the translation work is huge, please be aware that proofreading is another big part, and different. 

So the final word is: you’re more than welcome to help us having our ecommerce solution translated if/as long as you’re willing to have PrestaShop head to the right direction. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of February 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Finnish** (87% translated vs 23% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (98% vs 47% in 1.7).
* **Macedonian** (99% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Korean** (47% vs 22% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (85% vs 61% in 1.7).

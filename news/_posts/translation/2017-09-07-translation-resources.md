PrestaShop is quite a large [open translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) and as a new translation contributor, you may wonder where to start. You’ll find here all you need to know to help with the translation of our e-commerce software, and a few tips to get you started. Thanks for your help!

## Translator guide

To get all the information about translating PrestaShop in Crowdin, read our Translator’s guide:
[PrestaShop_Translator_Guide.pdf](http://build.prestashop.com/assets/ext/PrestaShop_Translator_Guide.pdf)

This guide was written for PrestaShop 1.6, but most of it still applies to 1.7.

To better understand the 1.7 file structure, you can read this article:
[A New Translation System For PrestaShop 1.7](http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-translation-system-prestashop-17/#domains-structure)

## Live translation module

You can contribute to the Crowdin project more easily by using the **Live Translation** module.<br/>
It makes it possible to translate PrestaShop directly from your own shop and administration panel.<br/>
You’ll see strings in their original context, and you can translate them on the go. It’s much easier!

[Get the Live Translation module](http://build.prestashop.com/assets/ext/ps_livetranslation.zip){: .btn .btn-lg .btn-info}
{: .text-center}

### How to use the module

* Install the module by uploading its zip file to your shop (in the Modules page): [Live Translation module](http://build.prestashop.com/assets/ext/ps_livetranslation.zip)
* Log in to your Crowdin account
* Go to the Live Translation module configuration
* Click on "Translate" for either back or front office
* Translate! You can translate each string by clicking on it, it will send the translation directly to the Crowdin project.
* Click on "Disable" when you're done translating. Do not forget this last part ^^

### What you should know

* It only works for 1.7.1.0 version and later ones
* You must be logged in to your Crowdin account to make it work. If you don’t have one already, [join us](https://crowdin.net/project/prestashop-official)!
* Don’t forget to disable the module when you’re done!

### Troubleshooting

#### If you don’t have a Crowdin account

You won’t be able to use the Live Translation module, so please create a Crowdin account first.<br/>
Wait for your account to be validated, then log in to your again.<br/>
At this point, you can activate the Live Translation module and start translating.

#### If your shop is all about “crwdns” keys

You must reset the language to English (or your first language):

Make sure you select "Keep me logged in" when you access your back office.
When you're done translating, always click on "Disable" in the top banner.

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in March.

## Project news


### Next targets

Last month, Utopian announced that Steem rewards for translation contributions were suspended [until further notice]( https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@utopian-io/translation-contribution-submissions-paused-until-further-notice). But thanks to our amazing and dedicated translation community, we still have great levels for all the PrestaShop projects on Crowdin!

Now, to look further, here are our almost completed projects - if you feel like helping on it, I would be glad to welcome you: Catalan, the two Chinese projects, Czech, Danish, Estonian, Galician, Hungarian, Indonesian, Norwegian, Vietnamese. Hope to see you on those projects to push PrestaShop higher and make it available for a largest audience!


## A few stats

* **66 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **92,028 words have been translated** and **104,148 validated**.

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of March 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Finnish** (80% translated vs 27% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (98% vs 47% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (62% vs 32% in 1.7).
* **Korean** (54% vs 24% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (86% vs 61% in 1.7).

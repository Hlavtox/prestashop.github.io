Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in November!

## Project news

### üåê The translation of the User Documentation into Hungarian is in progress

[Levente K√≥r√©](https://crowdin.com/profile/korelewi) has started to translate the User Documentation into Hungarian. Great, isn‚Äôt it? So if you speak Hungarian and want to help him, feel free to send an e-mail to translation@prestashop.com or on the #translation [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg).
And a big thank you to Levi. I‚Äôm sure the community will benefit a lot from your contribution! 

### üì∏ Your pictures of the reward program

Between May and June, [SeongHyeon Cho](https://crowdin.com/profile/jaymz9634) translated an additional 3067 words. This allowed him to level up, from the Backpacker to the Adventurer level. The next step in the Reward Program is the Explorer level, with a minimum of 8500 translated words. I'm sure you can do it, SeongHyeon! :muscle: 

Thank you again for sending us a picture of your gift with a nice message, as always!

If you have received your gift too, don‚Äôt forget to send a picture to translation@prestashop.com so that I can share it in the next Crowdin report. 

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the efforts immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Levent√© K√≥r√©](https://crowdin.com/profile/KoreLewi), [Ersoy Yƒ±lmaz](https://crowdin.com/profile/eryilmaz), [Maurizio_Giambanco](https://crowdin.com/profile/Maurizio_Giambanco), [Serkan Subasi](https://crowdin.com/profile/serkans), and [Rick Gzz](https://crowdin.com/profile/rickygzz85). 

## A few stats
 
* **24 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **19,665 words have been translated** and **13,246 validated**.
* All this in **18 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Congratulations, and welcome to our new top contributors! :clap:
 
Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of November, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was already fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **14 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Danish | **Chinese Simplified** | Chinese traditional | English | 
| Estonian | French | Greek | Italian |
| Lithuanian | Portuguese, Brazil | Romanian | Serbian |
| Spanish | Spanish, Mexico | Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Persian are almost fully available. There is less than 2% of strings to proofread. 
There isn‚Äôt much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in November thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Chinese Simplified** (+6% to reach 100% translated and validated) 
* **Hungarian** (+4% to reach 85% translated and validated)
* **Turkish** (+4% to reach 99% translated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in September.

## Project news


### :muscle: Go full 1.7! 

Since version 1.6 is not maintained by PrestaShop anymore (read [this post](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1.6.1.x-what-s-next) to learn more about it if you missed the information), we feel that it will be more relevant to only mention the 1.7 in those reports from now on. So let’s all head to our latest version and be proud of it, there is so much to do!


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated Adib Aroui (aroui.adib), Chay Bourngern (benjarongmart), dress-safe, Efren Morales Martinez (EfrenMorales), Rolf Fuchs (higgs77), iansyhau, and lutek. See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **30 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **10,171 words have been translated** and **7,778 validated**.

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of September 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (93% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (94% vs 59%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (48% vs 14%).
* **Chinese Simplified** (95% vs 64%).
* **Tagalog** (51% vs 26%).

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in May!

## Project news

### New 1.7.8 translations are available for translation

The catalog of 1.7.8 translations has recently been added to Crowdin. This means that the completion rate for all projects has slightly decreased. Some projects that used to be 100% translated and validated are no longer complete.
Translators, proofreaders… your project needs you! Feel free to take a look at the new translations and help your language reach 100%!

### The reward program is back

In 2020, because of the sanitary crisis, our headquarters were closed and we were not able to send gifts to the top translators. But after a year, it was time to bring this reward program back to life! We also took the opportunity to reset the counters. From now on, we will only take into account the words translated from January 1, 2020. Last week, we sent about 20 packages to the top translators of the year 2020. Don’t forget to check your mailbox if this is your case. :mailbox:

[Jiří VALT](https://crowdin.com/profile/gvg) already received his package, and sent us a picture of the gift with a nice message! Thank you again for your involvement in the Czech project Jirka!

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [R0b3rt020](https://crowdin.com/profile/R0b3rt020) who rushed into the effort immediately! Thank you very much Robert!

## A few stats
 
* **16 members** were active on the project this month.

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since it is working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I will include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in August.

## Project news

### New manager of the translation projects 

My name is Julie. I joined PrestaShop on September 1st as the new Product Content Manager. I am very happy to start this new adventure and I am looking forward to working together on this translation project! :fire:
 

### New projects have been opened!

Would you like to try a new challenge? If you are fluent in one of the languages below, don’t hesitate to contribute. Here are the new projects that have been opened in August:  
Spanish (Costa Rica), French (Belgium), and Maltese.

I would like to thank gcocozza, jmcoget and jbonello who offered to open and help on the three projects. If you would like to start to translate a new language that is not yet available on PrestaShop, feel free to send me an email at translation@prestashop.com. :wink:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers
 
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated: PrestaServicePro, jbonello, Mohammad H. Bahrololoum  (mohdbahrololoum), Benny Lahmish (bennylh), Dzung Do (dzungdo), Dennis (icemansparks), Abdullah Alsheraidah (aalsheraidah) and partum. See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations! :fire:
 
At the end of August 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (52% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (100% vs 59%).
* **Esperanto** (44% vs 0%).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (93% vs 57%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in December!

## Project news

### :sparkles: Happy new year!

![Happy new year](/assets/images/2022/01/happynewyear.jpg)

Happy new year! As we walk into another new year, we want to thank you again for your contribution to the PrestaShop translation project. 
You have been so great this year. And the figures speak for themselves:

**2022 in numbers:**

* **291,053** words were translated
* **215,617** words were validated
* **176** new members joined the project
* **149** members were active

### :heavy_plus_sign: New strings were added to Crowdin to fix a bug

As you may have noticed, 5 new strings were added to Crowdin on January 5. It is usually not possible to add new strings outside the release of a minor or major version of PrestaShop. However, we made an exception this time in order to fix [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/27026#issuecomment-1004666063) that prevented users from accessing or modifying the translations of the Mail alerts module.

To go back to a 100% completion rate, those 5 strings will need to be translated and validated. They are located in the Modules > Emailalerts file. The good news is, as the strings are not really new, you should be able to use the TM and MT suggestions to save time.

Some of you had already done that, just a few minutes after the strings were added. You are so fast! :scream:

### 📸 Your pictures of the reward program

Between May and June, [Patrik Lindblom](https://crowdin.com/profile/extendus) translated an additional 2,798 words. This allowed him to level up, from the Traveller to the Backpacker level, and enter the reward program. 

Congratulations, and thank you again for your contribution to the Swedish translation project, Patrik!

In January, we will be sending out gifts again. Watch your mailboxes! :mailbox:

### 💕 Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the efforts immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Pawel Jarczewski](https://crowdin.com/profile/paulus33), [The Best Way](https://crowdin.com/profile/fouad.ao), [Ramon J. Batlle](https://crowdin.com/profile/rjbatllet), [HIỀN VŨ](https://crowdin.com/profile/hienvuneu), and [Roger Parera](https://crowdin.com/profile/rogerparerawm). 


## A few stats
 
* **20 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **29,048 words have been translated** and **10,122 validated**.
* All this in **16 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of December, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **14 languages**. That’s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Danish | Chinese Simplified | Chinese traditional | English | 
| Estonian | French | Greek | Italian |
| Lithuanian | Portuguese, Brazil | Romanian | Serbian |
| Spanish | Spanish, Mexico | Swedish |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Persian are almost fully available. There is less than 2% of strings to proofread. 
There isn’t much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in December thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Catalan** (+5% to reach 99% translated) 
* **Hungarian** (+5% to reach 90% translated and validated)
* **Hebrew** (+2% to reach 74% translated and validated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

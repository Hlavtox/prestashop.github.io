Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in January!

## Project news

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers  
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Laimonas Matukas](https://crowdin.com/profile/lmatukas), [Jussi Lahtinen](https://crowdin.com/profile/j-lahtinen), [Arman Hosseini](https://crowdin.com/profile/Arman-Hosseini), [Zafer ÖZTÜRK](https://crowdin.com/profile/PrestaTurk), [jordipagano](https://crowdin.com/profile/jordipagano), [8i11y](https://crowdin.com/profile/8i11y), and [Armand](https://crowdin.com/profile/rubujeto/activity). 

## A few stats
 
* **33 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **14,139 words have been translated** and **5,860 validated**.

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since it is working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it is important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of January, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Esperanto** (69% translated vs 19% validated).
* **Galician** (98% translated vs 58% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (51% translated vs 11% validated).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (91% translated vs 56% validated).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you would like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!
 
If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I will include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Do not hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in January.

## Project news


### A more international translation

I must admit, it is quite stunning to see how the Crowdin PrestaShop project is growing. Each monthly report highlights bigger numbers than the previous one, we are now talking about hundreds of thousands of words translated, it has nothing to do with the ten thousands we used to get when I arrive. And this is the amazing part of dealing with such a large and dedicated community. Because every merchant can help and then enjoy the benefits of this massive involvement in completing the translation rates. After the interview of [Roberto Calisto](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-interview-roberto-calisto), who helps a lot with the Portuguese, here is another post about the translation of the software and what has happened lately.


## A few stats

* **119 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **274,918 words have been translated** and **95,614 validated**.
* All this in **19 different languages**.

Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of January 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Filipino** (65% translated vs 0% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (98% vs 46% in 1.7).
* **Latvian** (66% vs 24% in 1.7).
* **Macedonian** (100% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (100% vs 78% in 1.7).

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in October.

## Project news


### Newcomer

As some already know, Alexandra has left PrestaShop at the beginning of October. So here I am, walking in her footsteps as a Product Content Manager, in charge of the translation projects on Crowdin and of Build's editorial... A brand new adventure I'm glad to be part of!

### 1.7.3 is out for translation

It has arrived, finally! We are now entering code and string freeze in order to pave the ground for a solid and reliable new minor version. It should be release in a month or so - we will let you know! Regarding the translation projects, it means new that strings cannot be added but also that the [1.7.3](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) has appeared, containing fresh strings ready to be translated and then approved by you all! A more detailed blog post will be published very soon, meanwhile you can start working on the 1.7.3 version. Yippie yeah!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of October 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Korean** (44% translated vs 16% validated in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (56% vs 37% in 1.7).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (100% vs 81% in 1.7).
* **Arabic** (53% vs 39% in 1.7).
* **Catalan** (93% vs 80% in 1.7).

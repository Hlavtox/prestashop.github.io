Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in December!

## Project news

### Happy new year 2021!

![Happy New Year](https://lvpfn.stripocdn.email/content/guids/CABINET_309f2cc69b90f44bbc912e3ddf46c57f/images/47601608718667750.gif)

We wish you a happy and healthy new year! Thank you for your involvement in the PrestaShop translation projects this past year, you have been wonderful! Let’s continue the great teamwork in 2021! :muscle:

### Bosnian language is now fully available

After an incredible rise, from 58% to 100% in just a month, the Bosnian language is now fully available for the 1.7.7 version! A big thank you to [Rijad Osmanovic](https://crowdin.com/profile/rijado), who is also the top translator AND proofreader of the month. Congratulations! :fire:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers 
 
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Jiří VALTR](https://crowdin.com/profile/gvg), [Store](https://crowdin.com/profile/helabasa), [Kiana Vafaei](https://crowdin.com/profile/k1994v), [Paolo Battistella](https://crowdin.com/profile/paolo.battistella), [Alex Darcy](https://crowdin.com/profile/nachtzehrer), and [Emin çaki](https://crowdin.com/profile/emincaki)!

## A few stats
 
* **29 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **43,689 words have been translated** and **38,579 validated**.
* All this in **24 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of December, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Esperanto** (61% translated vs 19% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (51% translated vs 11% validated).
* **Galician** (98% translated vs 58% validated).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (91% translated vs 56% validated).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:

Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in May.

## Project news


### First news, Swahili will be available in PrestaShop 1.7.8 :tada:

I have the pleasure to announce that PrestaShop will finally be available in Swahili in the 1.7.8 version! I thus encourage you to translate, suggest, and proofread the PrestaShop Swahili 1.7.7 translation project. Currently, there aren’t many Swahili translators on PrestaShop’s Crowdin community, so if you know any Swahili natives, spread the word and do not hesitate to invite them to participate in the [PrestaShop Swahili translations project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/sw#), they will be more than welcome! :heart_eyes:

### Daily language packs updates

Many of you asked why the translated strings were not updated in their shop, even though they have translated and approved strings, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you how translation packs are updated in PrestaShop now.

Translations are updated everyday with a 24 hours delay. Every morning our developers send an export request to Crowdin, but since the exporting process takes some time, they download the export made the day before and send the files to [Github](https://github.com/PrestaShop/TranslationFiles). When the repository is updated, a robot will gather the translation files and make them available to download. 
But one detail to take into account is that only translations of the last version, the 1.7.7, are updated. 

Since PrestaShop 1.7.7 hasn’t been officially released yet, what you can do is to translate and approve strings of the 1.7.7 version, retrieve these strings from translationfiles and upload them on: app/Resources/Translations/{localeCode}. 
It might be inconvenient for now but PrestaShop's developers team have in the backlog projects to make all new translations available for all shops from the 1.7.5 version and on, so let’s keep a positive mind! :sparkles:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, the PrestaShop team would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated: choefer, Çocuk Saatleri (cocuksaatleri), nenowasaleh, Pacho Gonzalez (Pachogzz), Puunaama1, and Stella Georgakopoulou (Stella_Geo). See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations! :fire:
 
At the end of May 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (52% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (100% vs 59%).
* **Esperanto** (25% vs 0%).
* **Tagalog** (48% vs 24%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month :raising_hand:

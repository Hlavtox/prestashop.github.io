Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in April.

## Project news
 
 
### First news, new content manager :tada:
 
I would like to take this opportunity to present myself to all of you! My name is June, I joined the PrestaCrew as a Content manager last week, and I will be in charge of the Crowdin PrestaShop translation projects in the next several months. I am very excited about discovering this tool and am delighted to see that many of you from across the globe dedicate their time to these projects. I want to say thank you for your hard work, your contributions do not only help us but to anyone who is using or will be using PrestaShop ;) I look forward to communicating with you guys, if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me anytime, I would be more than happy to answer you :smiley:
 
### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers
 
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway.

JELLALI (abdelazizjellali), ymk0577, Schuster Lorenz (lorenzschuster), Goedkoopsteverf, Pedro Loureiro (pedrogrou82), Vitalie Ciobanu (VitCiobanu), Nietnagel, guarco, hismi, Micael Ferreira (micaelsf), Matas Šileikis (matassileikis), Goldylocks Portugal (goldylocks.portugal), ricardoalves, CuneytOral and Mickeycss (rockyluo). See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations :fire:
 
At the end of April 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (51% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (99% vs 59%).
* **Tagalog** (48% vs 24%).
* **Arabic** (94% vs 71%).

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact us with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. We need your help!
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month :raising_hand:

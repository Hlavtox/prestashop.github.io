Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in April!

## Project news

### New strings were added to Crowdin to fix a bug 

As you may have noticed, 42 new strings were added to Crowdin on May 6. It is usually not possible to add new strings outside the release of a minor or major version of PrestaShop. But we had to do it to fix [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailalerts/pull/57) that prevented users from accessing or modifying the translations of the Mail alerts module.
To go back to a 100% completion rate, those strings will need to be translated and validated. 

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the efforts immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [onlineschmiede](https://crowdin.com/profile/onlineschmiede/activity), [Mariusz Sienkiewicz](https://crowdin.com/profile/mariuszsienkiewicz/activity), and [Lorenz Meyer](https://crowdin.com/profile/lmeyer/activity). 

## A few stats
 
* **15 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **61,576 words have been translated** and **62,808 validated**.
* All this in **13 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

## Top contributors

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of April, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **20 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Bosnian | Catalan | Chinese simplified | Chinese traditional | 
| Czech | Danish | English | Estonian | 
| Finnish | French | Hungarian | Italian |
| Lithuanian | Persian | Romanian | Serbian | 
| Spanish | Spanish, Mexico | Swedish | **Ukrainian** |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, in order to get back to a 100% completion rate, all the [new 1.7.8 strings](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-178-translations/) should be translated and validated... Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean is almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isn‚Äôt much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in April thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Ukrainian** (+14% to reach 100% translated and validated) 
* **German** (+4% to reach 100% translated)
* **Polish** (+1% to reach 96% validated)

Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

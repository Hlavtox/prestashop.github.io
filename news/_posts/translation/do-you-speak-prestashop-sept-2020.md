Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in September.

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers
 
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! 

So lots of love to the dedicated: [A. L](https://crowdin.com/profile/roynsdx), [Artjom Shapenkov](https://crowdin.com/profile/t10arsh), [Tanoue](https://crowdin.com/profile/Tanoue), [WEB.Com.Az](https://crowdin.com/profile/WEB.Com.Az), [Daniele1970](https://crowdin.com/profile/Daniele1970) and [Pietro Arturo Panetta](https://crowdin.com/profile/arturu). 

See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of September 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Esperanto** (57% vs 13%). (But we can observe an increase of 13% since last month! Congratulations! :fire:)
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (52% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (100% vs 59%).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (93% vs 57%).

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:

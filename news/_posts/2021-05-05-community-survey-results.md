The core product team carried out a survey in April, concerning the open source project and for the community. The goal of this survey was to better know and understand the pains and the wishes of the community about the open source project.

## :two_hearts: Special thanks to the respondents

We received 98 responses, which makes a completion rate of 28,6%, and wanted to thank everyone who participated in this survey. Your opinions are very important for us and we care a lot about your satisfaction!

## Results of the community survey of April 2021

### How do you contribute to the open source project?

The answers to the first question show that the majority of contributors report bugs and suggest improvements or new features for the open-source project. 

The code contribution with pull requests comes in 3rd position with 35.7%.

And 21.4% of respondents do not contribute to the project.

Remember that the best way to contribute to the open-source project is to open an issue when you are facing a problem and to fix it with a pull request if you have the technical skills. 
If you are not a developer, you can consider hiring a specialist to help you. If you manage to get the problem fixed, then contribute the fix back to the project as a Pull Request. Remember that the more people contribute, the better PrestaShop becomes for everyone :muscle:

### When do you contribute to the open-source project?

54.5% of the respondents contribute during their working time, while 45.5% contribute in their free time.

### Sort the opportunities for the open-source project in order of importance 

The 2 most important opportunities identified are the fix of the major prices, taxes, and cart rule issues.

Then comes the update of the Symfony LTS version and the support of PHP 8.0

### Sort the technical subjects in order of importance

The first subject that goes back to this question is the fix of major bugs.

Then comes the simplification of integrating development in the back-office and extending PrestaShop.

It's followed by the Symfony migration of the back office.

### Sort the community topics in order of importance

What matters most to the community is the review & merge of pull requests and the review of the feature requests.

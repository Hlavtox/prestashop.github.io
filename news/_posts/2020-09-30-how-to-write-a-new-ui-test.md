One year ago, the QA team started to develop a new test framework, based on [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). You can read more about the framework in a previous [article](https://build.prestashop.com/news/the-new-prestashop-test-framework/).
Since then, the tests coverage has been continually increasing and we recently improved our framework by switching to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

In this article, we will explain how to create a new UI (User Interface) test for the [PrestaShop core project](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop).

Before we start, you should definitely read about our stack and architecture in the [PrestaShop devdoc](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/testing/ui-tests/how-to-contribute-and-create-ui-tests/). 


## I. Writing the scenario

The first step to writing your scenario is to identify exactly what you want to test, and limit the test's scope to that. For this example **we will be checking that the customer link in the Back Office "Orders" page redirects to the "view customer" page**.
The second step involves a manual check of this very scenario to be sure it's working, and to write down all the steps needed, from start to finish.

Now that you have the scenario, you can create a new javascript file and write your scenario using Mocha (see example below).

```js
// 'describe' = scenario
// 'it' = step

describe('View customer form orders page', async function(){
  it('should login in BO');

  it('should go to orders page');

  it('should reset all filters');

  it('should filter orders by customer name');

  it('should check customer link');

});
```

Note 1: The directory in which you create your file should be chosen wisely (which campaign? BO or FO? Which page in BO? ...). This file organization is very important since Mocha lets you run test by folders (recursively or not), so grouping your tests by features or meta-features (pages) is a very good idea.

Note 2: You can create nested `describes` (scenarios inside scenarios) in the same file, if you need to regroup some tasks in a more readable way. Keep in mind that the generated report will follow your hierarchy!

Note 3: It's a good practice to add more information about the scenario as a comment before the main `describe`, so anyone opening the file can see what the test exactly do.

```js
/*
Go to orders page
Filter by customer name 'J. DOE'
Click on customer link on grid
Check that 'View customer' page is displayed 
 */
```

## II. Opening the browser tab

For each and every UI test, we need a browser. This framework includes a set of helper functions to abstract all of this: open a browser, create a new browser context and/or a new tab, etc.

The helper file is located in the `utils` directory and we can require it using the module-alias library as below:

```js
require('module-alias/register');

const helper = require('@utils/helpers');
```

Note: To find all the shortcuts you can use with module-alias, check the package.json file.

Once we included the helper, we are able to create the [`before`](https://mochajs.org/#hooks) function inside our `describe`.

```js
const helper = require('@utils/helpers');

let browserContext;
let page;

/*
Go to orders page
Filter Bu cutomer name 'J. DOE'
Click on customer link on grid
Check that 'View customer' page is displayed 
 */
describe('View customer form orders page', async function(){

  before(async function () {
    browserContext = await helper.createBrowserContext(this.browser);
    page = await helper.newTab(browserContext);
  });

  it('should login in BO');

  it('should go to orders page');

  it('should reset all filters');

  it('should filter orders by customer name');

  it('should check customer link');

});
```

Note: In the `before` function, we only need to open the browser context and the page (the browser tab) through the `createBrowserContext()` method. We don't need to worry about opening the browser itself because it's handled by the [setup file](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/testing/ui-tests/how-to-contribute-and-create-ui-tests/#setup), which is a file executed by mocha before each run.

## III. Using common tests

Some steps are used repeatedly in a lot of scenarios, so the QA team decided to store them in a folder called `commonTests`.

First we need to require the file containing the steps we're interested in, still using the require module like before:

```js
// Require common test login
const loginCommon = require('@commonTests/loginBO');
```
`Login BO` (with the default admin account) is a part of these common tests, and we can use it in our new test like this:

```js
it('should login in BO', async function () {
  await loginCommon.loginBO(this, page);
});
```
Note: You can specify another user and password.

```js
it('should login in BO', async function () {
  await loginCommon.loginBO(this, page, 'yourLogin', 'yourPassword');
});
```

## IV. Requiring needed pages

Each test has its own needs! After writing the scenario, we now know which pages are needed. For this example, we need the following Back Office pages: "dashboard", "orders", and "view customer".

```js
// Import pages
const dashboardPage = require('@pages/BO/dashboard');
const ordersPage = require('@pages/BO/orders');
const viweCustomerPage = require('@pages/BO/customers/view');
```

Note 1: To find the exact locations of the pages to require, read [How to contribute and create UI tests](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/testing/ui-tests/how-to-contribute-and-create-ui-tests/#pages), or explore the `pages` folder.

Note 2: If a page doesnâ€™t exist yet, you need to create it (in the right folder).



## V. Filling out the steps

Each step of the scenario is made of two parts: **actions** and **expected results** (through data reporting). Actions are functions in the pages.

Before adding them, you should check for existing ones and their parameters.

### Actions

Actions replicate what a user would do in the page (click on an item, fill out text field, etc).

```js
it('should go to orders page', async function () {
  // Action
  // Open Menu and go to orders page
  await dashboardPage.goToSubMenu(
    page, // Browser tab
    dashboardPage.ordersParentLink, // Parent menu item: Sell -> orders
    dashboardPage.ordersLink, // Child menu item: Sell -> orders -> orders
  );
});

it('should reset all filters', async function () {
  // Action
  // Reset filter in orders list and get number of element
  await ordersPage.resetAndGetNumberOfLines(
    page, // Browser tab
  );
});

it('should filter order by customer name', async function () {
  // Action
  // Filter order by filling 'customer' input with 'DOE' (lastname of FO default account) 
  await ordersPage.filterOrders(
    page, // Browser tab
    'input', // Filter type (input or select)
    'customer', // Filter column
    DefaultAccount.lastName, // Filter value 'DOE'
  );
});

it('should check customer link', async function () {
  // Action
  // Click on customer link in first row
  await ordersPage.viewCustomer(
    page, // Browser tab
    1, // First row in list
  );
});
```
Here we use differents **actions** methods, like `goToSubMenu()` in the dashboard page, or `resetAndGetNumberOfLines()` in the orders page.

Note: To filter orders, the method uses the FO default account which is part of demo data stored in *data* directory. For this scenario, you need to require this file:

```js
// Import customer 'J. DOE'
const {DefaultAccount} = require('@data/demo/customer');
```

### Expected results

Data reporting (or "expected results") is done by checking elements in the page and returning a value (number of lines in a table, content of a modal, value of an input, etc).

This framework uses the *expect* element from the [Chai library](https://www.chaijs.com/), so we need to require it:

```js
// Import expect from chai
const {expect} = require('chai');
```

You can then add your `expect` calls in the test logic:

```js
it('should go to orders page', async function () {
  // Action
  await dashboardPage.goToSubMenu(
    page,
    dashboardPage.ordersParentLink,
    dashboardPage.ordersLink,
  );

  // Expected result
  // Verify that the current page is orders by checking the title
  const pageTitle = await ordersPage.getPageTitle(page);
  await expect(pageTitle).to.contains(ordersPage.pageTitle); //we compare with the value stored in the page object
});

it('should reset all filters', async function () {
  // Action
  const numberOfOrders = await ordersPage.resetAndGetNumberOfLines(page);

  // Expected result
  // Check that number of orders > 0 (that there's at least one element in the list) 
  await expect(numberOfOrders).to.be.above(0);
});

it('should filter order by customer name', async function () {
  // Action
  await ordersPage.filterOrders(
    page,
    'input',
    'customer',
    DefaultAccount.lastName,
  );

  // Expected result
  // Check that we have at least 1 order for the customer named "J. DOE"
  const numberOfOrders = await ordersPage.getNumberOfElementInGrid(page);
  await expect(numberOfOrders).to.be.at.least(1);
});

it('should check customer link', async function () {
  // Action
  page = await ordersPage.viewCustomer(page, 1);

  // Expected result
  // Verify that the current page is "view customer" by checking the title 'View information about J. DOE'
  const pageTitle = await viweCustomerPage.getPageTitle(page);
  await expect(pageTitle).to
    .contains(`${viweCustomerPage.pageTitle} ${DefaultAccount.firstName[0]}. ${DefaultAccount.lastName}`);
});
```

### Implementing a missing method

For this scenario, we used mostly existing functions like *filterOrders()*. You can check for existing functions in the `pages` directory. 

```js
  /**
   * Filter Orders
   * @param page
   * @param filterType
   * @param filterBy
   * @param value
   * @return {Promise<void>}
   */
  async filterOrders(page, filterType, filterBy, value = '') {
    switch (filterType) {
      case 'input':
        await this.setValue(page, this.filterColumn(filterBy), value.toString());
        break;

      case 'select':
        await this.selectByVisibleText(page, this.filterColumn(filterBy), value);
        break;

      default:
      throw new Error(`${filterBy} was not found as a column filter.`);
    }
    // click on search
    await this.clickAndWaitForNavigation(page, this.filterSearchButton);
  }
```

But there's a chance that a method you need is not implemented yet. Here it's the case for the *viewCustomer()* function.
 
```js
/**
 * Click on customer link to open view page in a new tab
 * @param page
 * @param row
 * @return {Promise<*>}, new browser tab to work with
 */
viewCustomer(page, row) {
  return this.openLinkWithTargetBlank(
    page,
    `${this.tableColumn(row, 'customer')} a`,
    this.userProfileIcon,
  );
}
```

## VI. Running your scenario

After you have finished writing your scenario, implementing missing functions... it's time to test your test! 

```shell script
TEST_PATH="functional/BO/02_orders/01_orders/08_viewCustomer" URL_FO=shopUrl/ npm run specific-test

 View customer from orders page
    âœ“ should login in BO
    âœ“ should go to orders page
    âœ“ should reset all filters
    âœ“ should filter order by customer name
    âœ“ should check customer link
 5 passing (19s)
```

## VII. Adding steps Identifiers

Steps identifiers help track failing steps between different runs thanks to the [nightly](https://nightly.prestashop.com/) algorithm.

Each step should have its own! You can found more information [here](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/testing/ui-tests/how-to-contribute-and-create-ui-tests/#test-identifier).

After adding this identifier, each step should look like this:

```js
it('should check customer link', async function () {
  await testContext.addContextItem(this, 'testIdentifier', 'viewCustomer', baseContext);

  // Click on customer link in first row
  page = await ordersPage.viewCustomer(page, 1);

  // Verify that the current page is view customer by checking the title
  const pageTitle = await viweCustomerPage.getPageTitle(page);
  await expect(pageTitle).to
    .contains(`${viweCustomerPage.pageTitle} ${DefaultAccount.firstName[0]}. ${DefaultAccount.lastName}`);
});
```

Note1: The `baseContext` parameter should be declared in the beginning of the test. It's must be unique, and for that we used the test's file path.

```js
const baseContext = 'functional_BO_orders_orders_viewCustomer';
```

Note2: No need to add a step identifier to common steps, they already have one.

## VIII. Running ESLINT

ESLint is a tool currently used by the QA team that helps enforce code style rules in JavaScript files. To run it, use the command *npm run lint*. You may have to fix errors reported by this tool before submitting your UI test.

```shell script
npm run lint-fix

> ESLINT  --fix --ignore-path .gitignore .

```

## IX. Creating your pull request

Now that the test is ready, it needs to be added to the PrestaShop tests campaign! You can do so by creating a pull request, following the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop#contributing).

Link to the PR used for this example: [#20280](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/20280).

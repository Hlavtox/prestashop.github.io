In March 2020, the product team at PrestaShop, in charge of building and prioritizing new features, decided to work with a new tool: [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com). It helps product managers to create relevant roadmaps by evaluating features and tracking their development.

Productboard made two things possible for the team:
- Having a team interface to centralize all feedback, organize them, define features, prioritize them, and follow their development.
- Having a public space, where the team is able to publicly present these features and to collect feedback about them. **And that is what this article is about.**

So the team has created this space called [**PrestaShop Feedback**](https://feedback.prestashop.com) where anyone can comment, and vote for the next features in the roadmap, whether you are a merchant, a developer, an agency, a seller on the [Addons Marketplace](http://addons.prestashop.com/),...
This space is accessible at [feedback.prestashop.com](https://feedback.prestashop.com).

Before explaining how to use the **PrestaShop Feedback** website in the [second part](#how-to-use-prestashop-feedback), here is some context and information about how product development is done at PrestaShop. We‚Äôll try to keep it short here, feel free to ask the team if you want to learn more about it.

## PrestaShop‚Äôs product development cycle

### The Core product team
At the Prestashop company, a team is dedicated to maintaining the PrestaShop open source project: the Core team.
Its mission is to make sure the software is stable, usable, delivers value to its users and follows the industry standards.
All this requires several people and several skills. Today the Core team is composed of developers, QA engineers, designers and product managers.
Editing and maintaining a software like PrestaShop means fixing bugs but also adding improvements and new features.

While bug fixing is most of the time handled directly by developers (from the Core team and the community üòâ), features design and development are much more complex. Why? Because the goal of any feature is to help users achieve something, **behind every feature there should be a user need**.

As a team working on a software, when you add a feature you are making the software more complex- more complex to use and more complex to maintain. So, on one hand, you can‚Äôt afford to add any useless feature and, on the other hand, you have to make sure what you add is usable.
And that‚Äôs where product managers and designers are needed.
Product managers are responsible for making sure the software delivers value to its users. And the first steps to do so are to know which features to improve or to create, and more importantly to know which users‚Äô needs you have to solve.

Once you know where to focus and what you are trying to solve, you have to design this feature, to make it tangible, usable and coherent with the existing software. That is the designers‚Äô and the product content manager's responsibility.

While the product manager‚Äôs job is to identify the problem to solve, the designer's job is to design the best solution, of course, this is done in collaboration, as a duo. And then the whole team altogether can start building the feature.


Currently the Core team counts 9 developers, 5 QA engineers, 2 designers and 5 product managers.

### How to know what to focus on?

Everything starts with feedback. Without feedback, without talking with your users, you are blind, lost in the fog.

PrestaShop being an open source project, the team can rely on its tremendous community to gather feedback, identify pain points and discuss many topics.
Right now, collecting feedback is not difficult, Github is probably the main source, but there are also events such as [ambassadors' meetups](http://ambassadors.prestashop.com/ambassadors) and [PSD](https://events.prestashop.com/), user interviews regularly conducted by the product team and the [community Slack](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/blob/master/slack/readme.md).
The team also keeps an eye on what‚Äôs happening around in the e-commerce and CMS industries to make sure the software goes in the right direction regarding the market's evolutions and expectations.

Collecting feedback is easy. What is more difficult is to centralize and analyze it in order to identify the users‚Äô needs lying behind.

Productboard will help the team here. By making it easier and automatic to centralize feedback directly in the same place. Wherever it comes from.
The team calls these feedback **insights**. On Productboard, product managers can create topics to group **insights** together, this step helps form a first **expression of needs**. Sometimes the expression of needs already gives the best solution, sometimes it is still a bit early to know how it could be solved.

What‚Äôs in it for the community? Well Productboard also makes it possible to share that externally.
This is great to inform the community about what the team has identified, and also to keep collecting more information about it to improve the team‚Äôs understanding on this problem.
**You are now able to see these expressions of needs on the PrestaShop Feedback website**

### How to go from a need to a feature?
Centralizing and analyzing insights is difficult.
Well, the next step in product development is even more difficult: prioritizing the users' needs.

PrestaShop is used on 300k+ online stores around the world, and its community gathers more than 1 million people.
There are hundreds of needs out there, waiting to be solved. So how does the team decide what to build next?

The Core product team uses several criteria to evaluate the importance of a need. There is no scientific, or magical, formula. It is a list of aspects that the team reviews in light of the research and analysis previously run. Among these aspects are:

- the impact on the merchants‚Äô businesses,
- the impact on merchant productivity,
- the impact on the developer experience,
- legal requirements,
- and many more...

As you can see, it is important for the team to take into account all the impacts of solving a need, and building features.
And that is something that Productboard makes easier too.

In the PrestaShop Feedback space, as a visitor, it is possible not only to add comments but also to rate the impact of an expression of needs or a feature on oneself. Three values exist: Nice-to-have, Important, and Critical.
This rating is directly taken into account in Productboard and gives a **user score**. More about it in the second part.


### Designing a feature
Lastly, once you know what to focus on, and what you should work on next, it is actually time to design the feature, to define what to build.

All the product development process at PrestaShop is summarized in the following chart.

![Product development steps at PrestaShop](/assets/images/2020/05/product-development-steps.png)

Designing a feature means defining what is the best solution to a problem, a need.
There are many ways to solve a problem. But design is not about solving a problem, it is about solving a problem the best way possible and with elegance.

The usual process to design and build a feature is the following:
- User Research
- Prototyping
- Specifications
- Development
- QA testing
- Release

And sometimes there are several iterations in between to reach a complete feature.

Well, that is also something that the Core product team will be able to share publicly from now on thanks to Productboard. You‚Äôll be able to see the features ‚ÄúIn progress‚Äù, and at which step they are in the process.
Once again, you will have the possibility to comment and share your opinion on what is being built. You can even reach us out if you want to take part in any prototype testing and/or development. We will appreciate it a lot!



Overall, Productboard will improve PrestaShop‚Äôs product development transparency and facilitate contributions from the community at every step of the process. From sharing an insight, to rating a need to solve, to contributing the user research, your voice will be heard and taken directly into account. That is the goal behind this move to Productboard.


Here is the second part, where you‚Äôll learn more about the PrestaShop Feedback interface.


## How to use PrestaShop Feedback

### See all features and expressions of needs, follow their development

Each feature or expression of needs is represented by a card that includes a title and a description, sometimes an image.
Click on a card to learn more about it.

All cards fall into several tabs, each corresponding to a specific step in the development of a feature:
- Under consideration
- In progress
- Ready for the next release
- Launched

![PrestaShop Feedback home](/assets/images/2020/05/productboard-home.png)

#### Under consideration
Lists all cards that are already specified. At this point, rating it and let the team know why this feature is important helps us prioritize it.

#### In progress
Lists all features in progress and distributes them among five sections: User Research, Prototyping, Specifications, Development, QA testing.

#### Ready for the next version
Lists all features that are already developed and thus available on GitHub's latest branch. In short, it means those features will be accessible in the next minor release: 1.7.7, 1.7.8, etc.

#### Launched
Lists all released features.


### Comment and vote for existing ideas
When clicking on a card you can see 2 fields at its bottom. One to comment, and one to vote on the feature's impact **on you**.

Voting for ideas is really important to help the team.
Here is what happens behind the scenes:

![PrestaShop Productboard user score](/assets/images/2020/05/productboard-user-score.png)

When rating the impact of a feature, Productboard adds your vote to a ‚Äúuser score‚Äù that the team takes directly into account when evaluating features through its prioritization score.
The more an idea is voted, the better rank it gets, and the more probability it has to integrate the software.

This ‚Äúuser score‚Äù is not the only indicator that the team takes into account when evaluating a feature but it is key. Complexity, innovation, business impact for the merchants, legal aspects, are some of the criteria studied as well.

<div class="alert alert-note" role="alert">
Of course, the goal is not to vote ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù on every feature idea. This would cancel the benefits of the open votes.</div>

Now you might also wonder what happens when you add a comment.
Well, the comment is automatically associated with the card in the team interface.
It helps the product team, the designers and the developers precisely identify the users‚Äô needs, and thus design the feature the best way possible to answer these needs.

In the end, it is all about delivering as much value as possible to the users, with all kinds of users in mind.

### Submit a new idea
In addition to seeing all the features ideas, commenting and voting, you can submit new ones.

A ‚ÄúSubmit an idea‚Äù button is located in the Portal‚Äôs top-right corner. Click on it and follow the steps.

![How to sumbit a new idea on PrestaShop Feedback](/assets/images/2020/05/productboard-new-idea.gif)

Here again you can indicate the importance of this insight for you.

Emails addresses are required by default by Productboard to avoid spamming.
The team might use it to contact you about your idea as well.


## What‚Äôs next
This is just the beginning, and the product team still needs some time to get used to the tool and to adapt its product development methodology.

One of the main problems the team had was to centralize all the feedback coming from several types of users, from different sources.
Having all this feedback in the same place will make it easier to have a better understanding of our users.

The team is looking forward to using it with you! Hope you‚Äôll like it!


**As always, let the team knows what you think about it in the comments section!**

As announced [here](https://build.prestashop.com/news/product-features-methodology-at-prestashop), the Core product team recently adopted a new working tool to gather feedback and prioritize features: [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com). No more teasing, it is now time to have a look at how it will look and how we will all be able to handle it!

Productboard makes two things possible for the team:

- On the one hand, having _a dedicated internal interface_ to centralize all feedback, group them into topics, define features, and prioritize them.
- On the other hand, having _an open public portal_ to explicitly present those features and collect feedback about them. **And that is what this article is about.**

So the team has created this portal called **PrestaShop Feedback** so that anyone can comment and vote for the features on which feedback is needed. Whether you are a merchant, a developer, an agency, a seller on the [Addons Marketplace](http://addons.prestashop.com/), etc. your opinions and suggestions are expected on the [feedback.prestashop.com](https://feedback.prestashop.com) page.

The portal, available in the 'PrestaShop Core' tab, is divided into several sections. The goal of this article is to explain how to use this interface to share your feedback on upcoming features.


## How to use PrestaShop Feedback

### See the selected features, express some needs, check their design

Each feature or expression of needs is represented by a card that includes a title and a description, sometimes an image.
Click on a card to learn more about it.

All cards fall into three sections, each corresponding to a specific step in the product development:

- Under consideration
- User research
- Design

#### Under consideration
Lists the topics and features that have already been identified and structured by the team. At this step, we need feedback to consider as many use cases as possible. It will allow us to draw the most useful feature. Also, rating a card to let the team know how important it is to you will help us prioritize it.

### User research
Lists the features the team decided to work on. When we start working on a feature, the first step is always to drive some user research to understand which types of users it may concern, what are the use cases around it, and its purpose. As the goal of user research is to identify the problem or need to solve, the purpose at this point is to get feedback to consider which problems are related to which cases.
The goal of the user research is to identify the problem or need, to solve.

#### Design
Once the problem is identified, the designers start working on the best solution to solve it.
This tab lists all the features going under design.


### Comment and vote for existing ideas
When clicking on a card you can see 2 fields at its bottom. One to comment, and one to vote on the feature's impact **on you**.

Voting for ideas is really important to help the team.
Here is what happens behind the scenes:

When rating the impact of a feature, Productboard adds your vote to a “user score” that the team takes directly into account when evaluating features through its prioritization score.
The more an idea is voted, the better rank it gets, and the more probability it has to integrate the software.

This “user score” is not the only indicator that the team takes into account when evaluating a feature but it is key. Complexity, innovation, business impact for the merchants, legal aspects, are some of the criteria studied as well.

Of course, the goal is not to vote “Critical” on every feature idea. This would cancel the benefits of the open votes.</div>

Now you might also wonder what happens when you add a comment.
Well, the comment is automatically associated with the card in the team interface.
It helps the product team, the designers and the developers precisely identify the users’ needs, and thus design the feature the best way possible to answer these needs.

In the end, it is all about delivering as much value as possible to the users, with all kinds of users in mind.

### Submit a new idea
In addition to seeing all the features ideas, commenting and voting, you can submit new ones.

A “Submit an idea” button is located in the Portal’s top-right corner. Click on it and follow the steps.

Here again you can indicate the importance of this insight for you.

Emails addresses are required by default by Productboard to avoid spamming.
The team might use it to contact you about your idea as well.


## What’s next
This is just the beginning, and the product team still needs some time to get used to the tool and to adapt its product development methodology.

One of the main problems the team had was to centralize all the feedback coming from several types of users, from different sources.
Having all this feedback in the same place will make it easier to have a better understanding of our users.

The team is looking forward to using it with you! Hope you’ll like it!


**As always, let the team knows what you think about it in the comments section!**

PrestaShop 8, the first major version since the original release of PrestaShop 1.7.0 back in 2016, is an important milestone for the project.

A significant cleanup has been performed in the codebase, with several internal components updated, modified or removed. PrestaShop 8 is also the project’s first company-neutral release, meaning that it no longer includes commercial products and services built-in.

In addition to [over 170 bug fixes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A8.0.0+label%3ABug+-label%3A8.0.x+-label%3APrerelease+-label%3A%22CI%2FCD%22) (including 4 new fixes since the [Release Candidate](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/prestashop-8-0-rc1-release/)), PrestaShop 8 brings compatibility with PHP 8.1, updated libraries including Symfony 4.4, an improved experimental product page, a new security page, and many other features for developers and merchants alike. You can read all about them here: [What’s new in PrestaShop 8](https://www.prestashop-project.org/releases/prestashop80).

PrestaShop 8 is a major version in the [SemVer sense of the word](https://semver.org/#summary). This means that while it brings several new features and a number of important changes, most themes from PrestaShop 1.7 should remain compatible with PrestaShop 8. Some modules, however, might need to be updated to be compatible with this new version. To learn more, read [Migrate your solutions from PrestaShop 1.7 to 8.0](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/migrate-your-solutions-from-17-to-80/), and the [detailed developer documentation](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/migrate-your-solutions-from-17-to-80/).

## Upgrade

**Important:** The [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) is not yet able to safely upgrade shops to PrestaShop 8.0 due to a number of known issues. The v4.15 release, enabling the upgrade to 8.0, is expected in the next few weeks. Stay tuned for news.

## Known issues

You can find the list of known issues here: [List of known issues on PrestaShop 8.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A8.0.x+label%3AVerified+label%3ARegression). The remaining regressions are expected to be fixed in upcoming patch releases.

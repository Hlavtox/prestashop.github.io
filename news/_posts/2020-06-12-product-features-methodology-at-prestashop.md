In March 2020, the Core product team at PrestaShop, in charge of building and prioritizing new features, decided to work with a new tool: Productboard.

You can learn more in this dedicated article about [how to use Productboard to share feedback on features the team is considering working on]().

The team thought it was the right occasion to talk more about the product development at PrestaShop, the steps, the roles and responsibilities and what happens behind the scenes before a new feature is added to PrestaShop.


## PrestaShopâ€™s product development cycle

### Core product team

At the Prestashop company, a team is dedicated to maintaining the PrestaShop open source project: the Core team.
Its mission is to make sure the software is stable, usable, delivers value to its users and follows the industry standards.
All this requires several people and several skills. Today the Core team is composed of developers, QA engineers, designers and product managers.
Editing and maintaining a software like PrestaShop means fixing bugs but also adding improvements and new features.

While bug fixing is most of the time handled directly by developers (from the Core team and the community ðŸ˜‰), features design and development are much more complex. Why? Because the goal of any feature is to help users achieve something, **behind every feature there should be a user need**.

As a team working on a software, when you add a feature you are making the software more complex- more complex to maintain and sometimes more complex to use. So, on one hand, you canâ€™t afford to add any useless feature and, on the other hand, you have to make sure what you add is usable.
And thatâ€™s where product managers and designers are needed.
Product managers are responsible for making sure the software delivers value to its users. And the first steps to do so are to know which features to improve or to create, and more importantly to know which usersâ€™ needs you have to solve.

Once you know where to focus and what you are trying to solve, you have to design this feature, to make it tangible, usable and coherent with the existing software. That is the designersâ€™ and the product content manager's responsibility.

While the product managerâ€™s job is to identify the problem to solve, the designer's job is to design the best solution, of course, this is done in collaboration with everyone. And then the whole team altogether can start building the feature.

Currently the Core team counts 9 developers, 5 QA engineers, 2 designers and 4 product managers.


### How to know what to focus on?

Everything starts with feedback. Without feedback, without talking with your users, you are blind, lost in the fog.

PrestaShop being an open source project, the team can rely on its tremendous community to gather feedback, identify pain points and discuss many topics.
Right now, collecting feedback is not difficult, Github is probably the main source, but there are also events such as [ambassadors' meetups](http://ambassadors.prestashop.com/ambassadors) and [PSD](https://events.prestashop.com/), user interviews regularly conducted by the product team, and the [community Slack](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/blob/master/slack/readme.md).
The team also keeps an eye on whatâ€™s happening around in the e-commerce and CMS industries to make sure the software goes in the right direction regarding the market's evolutions and expectations.

Collecting feedback is easy. What is more difficult is to centralize and analyze it in order to identify the usersâ€™ needs lying behind.

Productboard will help the team here. By making it easier and automatic to centralize feedback directly in the same place. Wherever it comes from.
The team calls these feedback **insights**. On Productboard, product managers can create topics to group **insights** together, this step helps form a first **expression of needs**. Sometimes the expression of needs already gives the best solution, sometimes it is still a bit early to know how it could be solved.

Whatâ€™s in it for the community? Well Productboard also makes it possible to share that externally.
This is great to inform the community about what the team has identified, and also to keep collecting more information about it to improve the teamâ€™s understanding on this problem.
**You are now able to see these expressions of needs on the PrestaShop Feedback website.**

### How to go from a need to a feature?

Centralizing and analyzing insights is difficult.
Well, the next step in product development is even more difficult: prioritizing the users' needs.

PrestaShop is used on 300k+ online stores around the world, and its community gathers more than 1 million people.
There are hundreds of needs out there, waiting to be solved. So how does the team decide what to build next?

The Core product team uses several criteria to evaluate the importance of a need. There is no scientific, or magical, formula. It is a list of aspects that the team reviews in light of the research and analysis previously run. Among these aspects are:

- legal requirements,
- the impact on the merchantsâ€™ businesses,
- the impact on merchant productivity,
- the impact on the developer experience,
- and many more...

As you can see, it is important for the team to take into account all the impacts of solving a need, and building features.
And that is something that Productboard makes easier too.

In the PrestaShop Feedback space, as a visitor, it is possible not only to add comments but also to rate the impact of an expression of needs or a feature on oneself. Three values exist: Nice-to-have, Important, and Critical.
This rating is directly taken into account in Productboard and gives a **user score**. More about it in the second part.


### Designing a feature

Lastly, once you know what to focus on, and what you should work on next, it is actually time to design the feature, to define what to build.

All the product development process at PrestaShop is summarized in the following chart.

![Product development steps at PrestaShop](/assets/images/2020/05/product-development-steps.png)

Designing a feature means defining what is the best solution to a problem, a need.
There are many ways to solve a problem. But design is not about solving a problem, it is about solving a problem the best way possible and with elegance.

The usual process to design and build a feature is the following:
- User Research
- Prototyping and design
- Specifications
- Development
- QA testing
- Release

And sometimes there are several iterations in between to reach a complete feature.


As always, let the team know what you think about it in the comments section!

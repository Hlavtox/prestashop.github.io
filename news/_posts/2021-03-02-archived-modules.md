Over the years, the PrestaShop project became host and maintainer for a very large number of open source modules. Last year, over 160 of them were present in our GitHub organization. As you probably know already, maintaining them requires a lot of work, and the maintainer team's resources are limited. Proof of this is that some of these modules have not been updated in years.

For this reason, the product team recently did a survey of almost 600 PrestaShop users to find out which modules were essential for their business and which ones they used the least.

As a result of this survey, the teams have decided to focus their efforts where it really matters. Rather than keeping hundreds of sparsely updated modules, starting this year, the PrestaShop Project will only commit to maintaining a smaller set of them â€“ the ones that are really important for users.

This is why the following set of modules, reported in the survey amongst the least often used, have been abandoned and their repositories archived: 

- [Visitors online](https://github.com/PrestaShop/statslive) 
- [Advertising block](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_advertising)
- [RSS products feed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_feeder)
- [Legal compliance](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_legalcompliance)
- [Product Notification](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_productinfo)
- [RSS feed block](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_rssfeed)
- [PrestaShop Cleaner](https://github.com/PrestaShop/pscleaner)
- [Tracking - Front office](https://github.com/PrestaShop/trackingfront)
- [Watermark](https://github.com/PrestaShop/watermark)
- [PrestaShop Security](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestafraud)
- [Google Analytics API](https://github.com/PrestaShop/gapi)

The following modules have also been archived but were already not available for the 1.7 stores because they are incompatible: [dateofdelivery](https://github.com/PrestaShop/dateofdelivery), [newsletter](https://github.com/PrestaShop/newsletter), [vatnumber](https://github.com/PrestaShop/vatnumber), [ps_carriercomparison](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_carriercomparison), [referralprogram](https://github.com/PrestaShop/referralprogram), [ps_healthcheck](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_healthcheck), [loyalty](https://github.com/PrestaShop/loyalty).


The repositories of these modules have been archived. This means that they will not be available in back-offices, but they are still available on GitHub. No further work will happen on these GitHub repositories, but developers can still fork them and use them.

PrestaShop is an open source and community project. If the PrestaShop project stops maintaining a repository, it does not mean this project is gone. What the project cannot do by itself, the community can do it. We might see contributors fork these modules and build a newer, better version that will surpass the current module.

Of course, you can also take a look at the marketplace where you could find similar modules to the archived ones.

On the other hand, we continue to maintain and provide for free the modules identified as essential by users in the survey, for example: [ps_facetedsearch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch), [ps_newproducts](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_newproducts), [ps_emailalerts](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailalerts), ...

If you have a feature need, please create a [feature request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=2_feature_request.md) on Github.
This list of modules is regularly analyzed to make it up-to-date with the user's needs.

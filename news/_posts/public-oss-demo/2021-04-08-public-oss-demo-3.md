## Next session in April

The next session will be streamed live on [**Wednesday, April 28, 2021 at 2pm CEST**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKb39T_6WHU).

We expect this session to be particularly interesting as PrestaShop 1.7.8 should have entered Feature Freeze by this time, meaning many projects will be complete.

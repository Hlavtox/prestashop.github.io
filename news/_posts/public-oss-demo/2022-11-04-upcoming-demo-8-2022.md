Friendly reminder, that the public demo for the PrestaShop Project from the maintainers team will happen next week, on [**Wednesday, November 9th, 2022 at 4pm CET**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRf0EQX3lbg)!

We expect to share with you project news and present two topics:

At the end of every meeting, we hold a Q&A session. You can ask your questions beforehand.

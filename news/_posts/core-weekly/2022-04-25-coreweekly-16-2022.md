## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week the maintainer team said [goodbye](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/pull/93) to [@PierreRambaud](https://github.com/PierreRambaud) who decided to leave the project leving behind a big gap and still sitting at the top of the [contributors](https://contributors.prestashop.com/) podium. Thank you for your outstanding work on the project, Pierre!

Work continues on 8.0.0, the next major version, and also on a [1.7.8.6 patch release](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/27973).

You might notice we have forked the [TCPDF](https://github.com/PrestaShop/TCPDF) repository in order to prepare the compatibility of PrestaShop with PHP8.1. This fork will be used until the upstream repository is compatible with PHP8.1.

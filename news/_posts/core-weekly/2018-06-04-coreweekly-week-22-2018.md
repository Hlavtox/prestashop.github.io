## General messages

In Paris next week? Please come and meet us at the [PrestaShop Day](https://prestashopday.com)! All the PrestaShop team will be there, among which several developers and the CTO with whom you will be able to exchange on hot topics like 1.7.4 or the 1.6 to 1.7 migration. BTW, If you want an invitation, I have a few left. Ping me on Twitter, I am [@ttoine](https://twitter.com/ttoine) and I will send you a coupon code via direct message. First come, first served.

Last minute news, I will be at [Open Expo Europe](https://openexpoeurope.com) in Madrid this week to speak about [PrestaShop and open source](https://openexpoeurope.com/session/how-open-source-has-been-a-key-for-adoption-and-success-of-prestashop/). See you there?

## General messages

Dear developers,

Work was slowed down on the project from Thursday to Monday due to technical issues affecting [PrestaShop services](https://twitter.com/PrestaShop/status/1433426744267055122).

The incident is now over. Teams continue to work on planned releases [PrestaShop 1.7.7.8](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25743), [PrestaShop 1.7.8.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/23010) and [PrestaShop 8.0.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/24111).

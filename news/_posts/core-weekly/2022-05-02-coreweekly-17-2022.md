## General messages

Dear developers,

The entire team is working hard on the PrestaShop 8 version, which [freeze date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_(software_engineering)) is a plan for mid-May - this is why we decided to cancel our May Public Demo to focus on the release, and then present the community with amazing demos in June.

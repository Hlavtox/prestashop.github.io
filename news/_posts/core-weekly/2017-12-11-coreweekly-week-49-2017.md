## General messages

As announced last Monday, the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) monthly [report](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-november-2017) has been published and it is filled with good news: at least 15 languages reached a 100% translated and approved branch 1.7.3, and 3 languages still need to be validated (Dutch, Greek and Portuguese, Brazilian). If interested, join us, we will be glad to have you with us! And Bosnian has entered the projects catalog again, with a completion rate which goes really fast. It is even our best progress of November, congratulations!

Contrary to what has been announced last week, and because we already wrote about how Symfony 3/PHP 5.6 will work in the future versions of PrestaShop in @mickaelandrieu's [post](http://build.prestashop.com/news/make-back-office-modules-great-again), we have decided to communicate on a new 1.7.3 important feature: PrestaTrust. So Margaux will talk about it. It is our first trust label and it will surely enhance the security of the PrestaShop modules. Innovative technology is right ahead to improve your experience, you will read how this week.

Last but not least, we are really happy to announce the 1.7.3 beta version is imminent, stay tuned!

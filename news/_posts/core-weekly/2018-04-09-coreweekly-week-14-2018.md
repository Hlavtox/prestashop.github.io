## General messages

Dear developers, for my first article as PrestaShop's new Developer Advocate, I have the feeling that many of you are waiting for the next release to come. Then, you should really read Pablo's article [Exposing Data With Confidence In PrestaShop 1.7]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/exposing-data-with-confidence/): you will learn how 1.7.3.1 will filter data it sends to the client-side. Stay tuned.

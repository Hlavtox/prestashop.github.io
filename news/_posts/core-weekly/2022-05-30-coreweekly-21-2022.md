## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week @atomiix was able to deliver [PHP8.1 compatibility for the Core](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/28402)! This is great news and it means PrestaShop 8 will be compatible with PHP8.1.

We will be able to explain more about this in the next session of the public PrestaShop demo that will happen [this week on Wednesday at 4pm CET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uXhWYFGDU).

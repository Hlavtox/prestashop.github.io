## General messages

Dear Developpers,

It still time to [test 1.7.5 beta](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-5-0-beta-release/). If you are hosting PrestaShop stores, it is the best way to be sure that the upcoming version will work on your infrastructure. If you are developping modules and themes, this is the best way be sure that your work will be compatible. If you find a regression, a strange behavior, or a bug, please [check if an issue is already open on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A1.7.5.0+), or [create a new issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose).

## General messages

Small week for pull requests, big one for communication! As we are moving fast towards the release, we are going deeper in our explanation of the changes to come. Indeed, @toutantic wrote about the migration towards the Symfony 3.4 framework [here](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-is-moving-to-symfony-3-4-and-php-5-6). Other important point was the law related to [Article 88](http://build.prestashop.com/news/france-article-88-loi-2017-1837-de-finances-2018) which asks French merchants to get their billing system certified, in order to prevent fraud.

Also, the Crowdin monthly report is quite impressive for December. Come on everybody, get closer (just [there](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-december-2017)) and have a look, it's worth it! A lot of languages, such as Bosnian and Chinese, have increased their rate of completion really fast. If it goes on like this, we have good hope to see PrestaShop gaining more than twenty fully available languages very soon. Community is the real force!

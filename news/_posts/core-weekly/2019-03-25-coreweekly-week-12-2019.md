## General messages

Dear Developers,

This is the very last week to submit a pull request and make it approved: code freeze is due on Friday, 29th of March.

The work of the maintainers is currently focused on code review and merge, plus finalizing their current work. Don't forget that each morning, you can download a fresh [nightly build](https://nightly.prestashop.com/) with the latest code merged in the PrestaShop open source project. That should help to build and test an Alpha release, hopefully next week.

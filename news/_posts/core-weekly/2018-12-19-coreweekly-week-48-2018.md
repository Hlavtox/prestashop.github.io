## General messages

Dear Developpers,

In case you missed, [PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 has been released](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-5-0-available/) yesterday. For merchants, the Christmas and Holyday periods are not the best time to upgrade. If, however, you are writing themes and modules, if you are a developer in an agency, or a freelance, or anyone else concerned about this new version or with the migration, please [download it](https://www.prestashop.com/en/download), install it, test it and [report feedback](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose) ;-)

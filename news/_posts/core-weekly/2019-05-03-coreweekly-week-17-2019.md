## General messages

Dear Developers,

That was amazing to see the huge mobilization to find workarounds in a hurry, during the weekend, to fix the [spam issue](http://build.prestashop.com/news/fighting-against-spamming-again/) with the account creation form.

You will see in this core-weekly the pull requests that fix this issue. And, in case your missed it, two versions of PrestaShop have been released this morning: [1.6.1.24 and 1.7.5.2](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-5-2-1-6-1-24-maintenance-release/).

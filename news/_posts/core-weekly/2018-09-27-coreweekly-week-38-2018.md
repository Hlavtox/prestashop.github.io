## General messages

Dear developers, in case you missed it, 1.7.5 code freeze was last week. An alpha version has been built and is currently being tested internally. A public beta will be released soon, please stay tuned and be prepared to test it on your server.

A new kanban has been created on PrestaShop's GitHub repository, dedicated to the [Symfony migration](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/3). Whether you are just interested to follow the migration, or you want to pick up a task and help, information is now easy to find.

New modules versions:

* [Auto Upgrade v4.3.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

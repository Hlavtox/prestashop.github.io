## General messages

Dear all, the PrestaShop maintainer team hopes that you are having a good time as the end of the year gets closer! The next Core Weekly will be published in 2022. We would like to thank you once again for being part of this community in 2021. One small step for each of you, one giant leap for the project!

This year has featured many important changes in PrestaShop and PHP.

[PHP 8.0.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php) was released at the end of 2020 and we have seen it slowly being adopted everywhere during 2021. The same happened for [PrestaShop 1.7.7](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-available/). We launched the [public demos](https://build.prestashop.com/news/first-public-oss-demo/), we released [PrestaShop 1.7.8](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-available/) and finally we announced what we expect to happen for the [future of PrestaShop](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-beyond-1-7/). We do not forget the birth of [the PHP foundation](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/) that we hope will improve greatly how the language evolves.

We hope to see more great news in 2022...

## General messages

Since version 1.7.3 is getting stabilized, we think it is time to talk about its major changes. In this direction, @mickaelandrieu has decided to publish a couple of articles. First [there](http://build.prestashop.com/news/make-back-office-modules-great-again), to explain to our devoted modules developers how using the Symfony ecosystem will make more powerful features. Second one at the end of the week, to present how Symfony 3 and PHP 5.6 will work together and improve PrestaShop.

By the way, what date are we, isn't it the beginning of December? It is, you're right, and the good thing is that anyone who says we are entering a fresh new month is saying that the Crowdin monthly report will be online soon... stay tuned then!

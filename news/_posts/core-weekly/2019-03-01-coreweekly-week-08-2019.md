## General messages

Dear Developers,

Last week, a very big piece of work has been merged into the "develop" branch: the [CLDR implementation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/10455). This work will allow the next version of the PrestaShop project to manage well things like localization and display of units and currencies, by following international standards used by many companies. As it needed a lot of code reviews and tests, less pull requests have been merged than usual that week.

[Learn more about CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/).

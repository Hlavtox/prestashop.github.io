## General messages

Dear Developers,

A change has been introduced in 1.7.6.0 in order to improve how currencies and carts are managed and displayed. And some bank payment modules are not working anymore. Unfortunately, this was not detected during the Beta and RC releases.

An issue has been opened on GitHub, and after investigation, [a solution has been proposed and tested](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14648#issuecomment-515989994). Please read this thread for details. TL;DR: the issue was actually not in the core, but in modules that were using a bad practice. And, that bad practice was working with previous versions of PrestaShop.

Some payments modules developed by the PrestaShop company are concerned and the module team is currently working to fix them. Stay tuned for updates if you are concerned.

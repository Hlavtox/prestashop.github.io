## General messages

Core weekly 19

Dear all, the long-awaited GDPR module is released for PrestaShop 1.6.x and 1.7.x. Below is a brief summary of what is available and where to find it:

* If you run a **1.7** store, go directly in the back office of your shop, you can install it for free; please note that it will be integrated into the core with the 1.7.4.x version of PrestaShop
* If you run a  *1.6** store, the module is available on the PrestaShop Addons marketplace with support, and it is visible in the back office of your shop
* If you run a **1.5** store, the module will be available soon on the Addons marketplace

A lot of feedback from the community has already been taken into account, thank you very much to everyone helping us to improve this very important feature.

The most notable change for the Core Weekly is that from now, the ‘develop’ branch regards the 1.7.5.x. So yes, it means that a 1.7.4.x branch has been created on the main repository.

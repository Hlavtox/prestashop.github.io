## General messages

Dear developers,

[PrestaShop 1.7.8.5](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-5-maintenance-release/) has been released last week because a [critical regression](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/27854) impacting hooks was detected in 1.7.8.4 release.

We suggest upgrading your store quickly to benefit from the bug fixes of this patch version. As usual, make sure to perform a full manual backup before, so you can roll back the upgrade if something goes wrong.

In the meantime, the [Hummingbird theme](https://github.com/prestashop/hummingbird) is showing some good progress! A [storybook](https://build.prestashop.com/hummingbird/) has been released and will be completed over time.

Please remember that your feedback on the project is welcome, so donâ€™t hesitate to join [us on slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/). The community is being regularly consulted there to make sure that topics like this new theme will meet the expectations and needs of everyone.

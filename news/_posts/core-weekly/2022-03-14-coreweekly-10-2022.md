## General messages

Dear developers,

A [bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/27835) was reported from users using Chrome latest version 99, the back-office login page display was incorrect. A fix has already been merged into `1.7.8.x` branch by @NeOMakinG. Thank you everyone involved in the issue and discussion.

In the meantime, we merged the [Pull Request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/27592) that moved Classic theme out of the Core repository. Classic theme has now its own [repository](https://github.com/prestashop/classic-theme) and is included inside PrestaShop through Composer (on `develop` branch).

## General messages

Dear developers, in case you missed it, patch versions have been released this week: [1.7.4.3 and 1.6.1.21](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-4-3-1-6-1-21-maintenance-releases/).

A quick word about the 1.7.5: you are all waiting for it, a public beta version should be available at the beginning of next week :-)

Also, please note that an issue has been identified with the Auto Upgrade module: if you have an error with some modules during upgrade (check logs and error messages), please try to updates the modules before starting the Auto Upgrade. You can [follow and see the details on issue #175 on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/issues/175).

Have a nice week-end.

## General messages

Dear Developers,

PrestaShop [1.7.7.1](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-1-maintenance-release/) has been released! Don't forget to update as this patch version fixes 41 regressions reported on version 1.7.7.0.

The kanban for `1.7.7` branch is not empty yet, it still contains unresolved regressions reported on version 1.7.7.0. The next batch of bugfixes for 1.7.7 will be delivered in patch version 1.7.7.2, which is scheduled to be delivered within [the next 6 weeks](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/project/release/minor-release-lifecycle/).

In the meantime, [@NeOMakinG](https://github.com/NeOMakinG) is building a brand new [Landing page](https://build.prestashop.com/user-documentation-landing/) for User Documentation.

Finally, maintainers also released a [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/PrestaShop/phpstan-prestashop) that should customize the rules being applied by [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) on submitted Pull Requests in order to help validating them.

## General messages

Dear Developers,

As you will see, the work on the upcoming 1.7.6 version is going on well, and the faceted search module is still needing some improvements.

The PrestaShop Developers Team is also working on content for the [PSD Paris 2019](https://www.prestashop.com/fr/evenements/prestashop-day-paris): most of them have a talk or a workshop. And they are eager to meet your there.

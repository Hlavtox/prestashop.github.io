## General messages

Who wants good news? We finally made it to the code freeze last week, version 1.7.3 is almost ready, hands in the air! For that, the dev team is working hard on its features to make it steady; they are all fixing bugs to release version 1.7.3 in a few weeks. In other words, no pull requests will be reviewed until this release - and when 1.7.3 is out, PRs will pertain to 1.7.3.1.

And it is the same for Crowdin, new strings have been added to the catalog, relating to the 1.7.3 features. It is now time to focus on the [1.7.3](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) branch to see more PrestaShop projects reaching 100% of translation and approval! Last Crowdin monthly report, [Do You Speak Prestashop?](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-october-2017), noted that big progress applied to some languages such as the Albanian and the Icelandic, let's keep on this good work to see your language(s) fully available!

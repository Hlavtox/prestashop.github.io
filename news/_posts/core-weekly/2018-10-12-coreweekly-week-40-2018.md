## General messages

Dear Developers, there are a lot of things to tell this week:

* [1.6.1.22 is out to fix a bug introduced in 1.6.1.21](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-22-maintenance-release/). If you have a shop in 1.6.1.21, this is mandatory to update. 
* It's official, the [end of life of PrestaShop 1.6.1.x is now in June 2019](https://www.prestashop.com/en/blog/Maintenance-extension-PrestaShop-1-6)
* We had a lot of issues with our APIs this week, and we are very sorry. Be assured that our top priority is make sure that every PrestaShop merchant is not disturbed anymore with this kind of issue, especially for the upcoming christmas season.
* Because of the other top priorities of this week, 1.7.5 beta is late. More news about it next week.

## General messages

Dear developers,

There is still a lot of effort focused on 1.7.8 in order to deliver a first Release Candidate.

In the meantime, here are some news about what's going on in the PrestaShop project:

An interesting discussion opened in issue [#24954](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/24954) about a change in terminology: it is about replacing "product combination" with "product variation".

The wording "combination" has been used for a long time in the Back Office, so changing it might create confusion. We would love to hear your feedback about this topic! To do so, feel free to complete [this survey](https://forms-prestashop.typeform.com/to/lgX5aZea) and share it with other PrestaShop users in your network.

You can also tell them about the incoming [public demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flyqo21eICg) that will happen next Wednesday, June 30, 2021 at 2pm CEST.

Finally, you might have noticed a change on the [Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/) website. The search bar is now being powered by [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) which is a free tool provided by Algolia for developer documentation websites.

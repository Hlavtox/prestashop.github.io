## General messages

Dear Developers,

An important step for the PrestaShop open source project has been completed last week and it is available today: the nighlty builds and tests dashboard. This is a new website: https://nightly.prestashop.com/.

Each night, a new build is created with the newly merged code. Then, the automatic tests are running for this build, and a report is created. It will help contributors to improve the quality of PrestaShop.

For now, you will see that many tests are failing. This will be improved and corrected during the weeks before the code freeze. And of course, your help is welcome ðŸ˜€

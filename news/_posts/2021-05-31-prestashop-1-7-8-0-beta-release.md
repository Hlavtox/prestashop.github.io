## How to help test 1.7.8

Your feedback on this beta is essential, the regressions you find right now are as many bugs less on the final version and less patches versions. It also means fewer problems on your (or your customer’s) online store. 

You must:

- Install it and test that there is no regression compared to the 1.7.7 version
- If you develop modules or themes, test them on this version
- Test the auto-upgrade plugin
- [Report regressions on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues) (read how to [report issues](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/contribute/contribute-reporting-issues/))
- Fix regressions by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare) (read the [contribution guidelines](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/contribute/contribution-guidelines/))
